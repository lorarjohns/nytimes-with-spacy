1848,‘Up Is Down’: Trump’s Unreality Show Echoes His Business Past - The New York Times,"As a businessman, Donald J. Trump was a serial fabulist whose biggest-best boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny. As a candidate, Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic: “Believe me.” Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office. “We’ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes, where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of “935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity,” a book about presidential deception. It was not just Mr. Trump’s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration, or his insistence (contradicted by his own Twitter posts) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community, or his audacious and evidence-free claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally. All week long, news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another. PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 “of the most misleading claims” Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city’s murder rate was “terribly increasing.” (The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade.) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office. But for students of Mr. Trump’s long business career, there was much about President Trump’s truth-mangling ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable “beliefs.” Mr. Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his best-selling book “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of “truthful hyperbole,” which he described as “an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.” It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was “a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy” in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s “alternative facts” on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s “1984,” in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” “In a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,” Mr. Schmidt said. “All authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state.” Mr. Lewis argued that the president’s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation’s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. “Fact-checking becomes an act of war by the media,” he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C.I.A. employees that he had “a running war with the media” and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth.” The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to “delegitimize” the new president and promised, “We are not going to sit around and let it happen.” By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as “the opposition party” during an interview with The New York Times. “It feels like this was part of the plan all along,” Mr. Lewis said. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s brazen willingness to deny “objective reality” had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. “I don’t know that he is doing it strategically,” she said, “but it certainly had the impact of a magician’s sleight of hand.” Deception, dissembling, exaggeration — what Fortune magazine called his “astonishing ability to prevaricate” — has deep roots in Mr. Trump’s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to small-time contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had “handpicked” each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however, fact-checking operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than two-thirds of the claims were “mostly false,” “false” or, in 62 cases, “Pants on Fire” false. “Trump is a different kind of figure than we’ve ever seen before in our 10 years of fact-checking,” Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. “No one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods.” Mr. Trump’s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. “There’s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,” Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president’s behavior as “strange” or “worrisome,” he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump’s first interview as president, David Muir of ABC News asked, “Do you think that your words matter more now?” “Yes, very much,” Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, “Do you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?” “No, not at all,” he replied. “Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do.” As if to prove the point, Mr. Trump then doubled down on his lie about millions of illegal votes. “Believe me, those were Hillary votes,” he said. “And if you look at it, they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn’t vote for me.” For Ms. Goodwin, Mr. Trump’s week of reality distortions brought to mind Lincoln’s address to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Ill., on Jan. 27, 1838, where he made an appeal to Enlightenment values as the best antidote to what he called the “mobocratic spirit.” “Reason — cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason — must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense,” he said. “He was worrying about authoritarian behavior,” Ms. Goodwin said.","Trump, Obama, president, Bush, White, House, President, campaign, adviser, Carson",us,politics
5736,Marco Rubio’s Campaign Echoes ’07 Tax Revolt: A Big Plan With Little Payoff - The New York Times,"MIAMI — It began with the audacity and promise of a rising political star. Marco Rubio, a young state lawmaker, was going to do what nobody had tried for decades: rewrite the bedeviling tax code in Florida and elevate his stature in the process. He delivered stirring speeches. He recruited wealthy donors. He persuaded a reluctant Republican establishment to sign on. But the strategy was presumptuous, and the follow-through was questionable. Resistance was greater than he had expected, and his ability to win over skeptics was not as great as he and his inner circle believed. In the end, he failed. In many ways, the episode, in 2007, foreshadowed Mr. Rubio’s faltering campaign for the White House. Today, those who counted on Mr. Rubio to emerge as the Republican standard-bearer and usher the party into a new era talk about the same shortcomings that doomed his sweeping tax plan: an overconfidence in the power of his charisma; an emphasis on inspiring messages, rather than nuts-and-bolts tactics; and a lack of finesse at crucial moments. “It showed how green he was in this process,” said Ed Connor, an antitax activist who was allied with Mr. Rubio during the 2007 tax push. “He didn’t know how to go about it.” Mr. Rubio declined, through a campaign spokesman, to comment on the tax plan or what he had learned from its demise. The idea, as advertised, was simple: replacing Florida’s surging property tax on primary residences with a 2.5-cent per dollar increase in the sales tax, in stages — a 42 percent rise that would lift the overall sales tax to 8.5 percent. A patchwork of rules and an overheated housing market had created a mess in Florida. Some homeowners, shielded by exemptions, paid exceedingly low property taxes; others, living in the same-size house next door without the same exemptions, paid three times as much. From 2001 to 2007, Floridians’ overall property tax burden doubled, to $30 billion from $15 billion. The Rubio plan would have saved the average homeowner about $2,300 a year. Mr. Rubio, then the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, had promoted it not just as a tax cut but as something much bigger: a restoration of basic, inalienable rights. Across Florida, in small-town church halls and big-city banquet rooms, Mr. Rubio had soothed homeowners furious about their property taxes with a radical message. Those property taxes, he told them, the foundation of local government in the United States since its birth, were a perversion of the country’s basic values — and until their abolition, nobody could ever really own his or her home. “How,” Mr. Rubio asked, “can we tax the American dream?” Antitax activists around Florida, progenitors of the Tea Party, celebrated his plan — and him, forging a bond that would bolster his campaign for the Senate three years later. “Nobody was as trusted on this issue as Rubio,” said David McKalip, a surgeon and a conservative activist who met Mr. Rubio at a demonstration protesting property taxes in St. Petersburg in 2007. The political conditions looked favorable: Republicans controlled both chambers of the Florida Legislature and the governor’s office. But in interviews, several of Mr. Rubio’s former House deputies and aides were blunt in their assessment of how he managed the property tax legislation, saying he lacked the political skills to outwit his counterparts in the Senate, who forced him to back a far more modest plan that left most of the existing tax system in place. It was a pattern that played out on several high-profile issues during his tenure as speaker: The Rubio-led House offered a bold but unworkable plan; the Senate rejected it; the House grudgingly accepted the Senate’s will. “It was a mistake for us to take the tax deal,” said former State Representative Will Weatherford, a Republican who went on to become House speaker. “Sometimes you have to be willing to say no. And that was an opportunity to say no.” (Like a number of Mr. Rubio’s former colleagues and deputies, Mr. Weatherford, who backed Mr. Rubio for the Senate, supported former Gov. Jeb Bush’s campaign for president before he left the race.) By the end of 2007, Mr. Rubio acknowledged that the compromise was insufficient when he traveled across Florida encouraging citizens to sign a petition that would put yet another attempt to cut property taxes on the ballot for voters. He was, in effect, encouraging Floridians to circumvent the legislative body he oversaw. But that effort, too, ultimately failed. His frustration was palpable. “This was a very big idea,” said Dan Gelber, the House Democratic minority leader at the time. “He would have been remembered for it for a very long time.” From the start of his speakership at the improbably young age of 34, big ideas were Mr. Rubio’s calling card. He traveled the state collecting them, from citizens and advocates and lawmakers, compiling the results in a book that he handed out to colleagues: “100 Innovative Ideas for Florida’s Future.” Some were far-reaching (a “model transportation system”); others were more parochial (changing the date of Florida’s presidential primary). But the 169-page volume instantly set him apart from the local politicians who had held the job before him, and it guaranteed him a profile beyond Tallahassee. Idea No. 96 was eliminating property taxes, a bold step in a state that has no income tax. It was a concept grounded in the conservative fiscal ideology of Arthur Laffer, the former Reagan administration economist, whose firm advised Mr. Rubio’s office, and was blessed by Grover Norquist, the high priest of Republican tax-cutting. Lawmakers called the proposed transition “the Swap” (exchanging property tax for a sales tax), but over all, they predicted, taxes would decline, potentially by billions of dollars, leaving government with less money to operate. For the conservative Mr. Rubio, those were two salutary, interwoven outcomes. But the Swap included real risks: It required lawmakers to raise one tax even as they wiped out another, opening them to attack; it would require local governments to make budget cuts; and it would do little or nothing for Florida’s lower-income home renters — in fact, it could cost them more money. According to analysis at the time, a 50-year-old lawyer who owned a home in Miami would save $10,496 a year under the Swap. But a 35-year-old waiter living in a Miami rental would owe $260 more, Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan state group, found. “It is a very regressive tax,” said Dominic M. Calabro, the longtime president of Florida TaxWatch. “The reality is that transaction-based taxes tend to be disproportionately on those of lower income.” It is the same critique leveled against Mr. Rubio’s tax plan as a presidential candidate: It disproportionately favors the rich. Going beyond traditional Republican fiscal demands, Mr. Rubio is calling for the elimination of all taxes on interest, dividends and capital gain income from stocks and for a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on business income, down from the current 35 percent. Back in 2007, Mr. Rubio countered that his property tax plan would make it easier for renters to become buyers by eliminating a major cost of homeownership, and that property taxes themselves were regressive. “Your property tax,” he argued at the time, “never adjusts. It doesn’t care if your spouse got sick last year, and you had to pay through your savings. Your property tax is your property tax, and your choice is you pay it or you lose your property.” He threw himself into the public relations and personal persuasion required to advance the legislation. Internal memos from his team talked up the benefits (“Imagine a Florida with NO income tax and NO property tax”) and the advice from ordinary constituents. (“This is NOT Tallahassee making policy mandates from ‘on high.’ ”) But as was typical, Mr. Rubio largely outsourced the corralling of votes to his deputies, having long ago distanced himself from the cajoling and coercive side of lawmaking. It was not in his comfort zone, a fact he did little to hide. “He stayed above the fray — sometimes very far above it,” said Mr. Gelber, the House minority leader. On his path to the speakership, Mr. Rubio had been asked to serve as House majority leader, a combative, vote-herding post that he feared would create too many enemies. So he persuaded Johnnie Byrd, then the speaker, to restructure the job to focus on communication, not arm-twisting, Mr. Rubio wrote in his book, “An American Son.” The softer-edged approach worked in the conservative-leaning House, where Mr. Rubio wielded immense influence over the lives of the young Republicans, from their committee assignments to their parking spots. In April 2007, it overwhelmingly passed Mr. Rubio’s property tax proposal. The smaller, sober, more moderate Senate, however, was immune to Mr. Rubio’s charms. “He was not popular with us,” said Victor D. Crist, a Republican state senator at the time. They viewed him, he said, “as a big show dog.” The Senate’s rejection of his tax swap was total: The chamber refused to even debate it. Privately, senators called it reckless and unworkable. Publicly, they ran out the clock on the 2007 legislative session, consigning it to death. Mr. Rubio pushed the Legislature into a special session, wagering that mounting public pressure to offer property tax relief would force the Senate’s hand. Poll after poll showed public outrage over property taxes but reservations about the Swap. In a special session dedicated to a single issue, however, Mr. Rubio had no bargaining power: There was nothing he could hold over the Senate’s head — no budget bill or infrastructure project it needed from him. After tense discussions with his House members, Mr. Rubio abandoned the Swap. Many House Republicans were furious with him. “They had put their re-election at risk only to see our plan abandoned,” he later wrote. “Some of the staff thought we were showing weakness by caving under pressure.” As negotiations dragged on, that suspicion soon re-emerged. The House kept signing on to less ambitious deals. By the fall of 2007, the Senate gave the House a final offer: a plan favored by Gov. Charlie Crist that doubled property tax exemptions. It was the opposite of the systemic, visionary change Mr. Rubio wanted. But it had the votes to pass. A group of House Republicans urged Mr. Rubio to fight on — to walk away from negotiations and even send his members home in protest to draw out concessions from the Senate. It was the kind of dramatic tactic the Senate had used on the House. Mr. Rubio accepted the deal instead. Something was better than nothing, he said. “There were a number of us who wanted to hold out for a better deal,” said Ellyn Bogdanoff, the Republican House whip during Mr. Rubio’s time as speaker. Looking back, Ms. Bogdanoff said, she understands his capitulation. “Marco’s idea about the tax swap was a hard sell; it probably should have taken three years,” she said. “But he basically only had a year to get it done. It was not enough time.” Mr. Rubio, in his book, conceded that his timing was poor. He should have started earlier, he said, building greater public support that could have overcome resistance from a Senate and governor who seemed determined to block him. But the idea’s allure has never waned for Mr. Rubio. In his campaign for president, he still speaks admiringly of a “fair tax” or national sales tax that would replace most existing federal taxes. “I’ve always said, if you were to start a country from scratch, that’s what you want to do — a consumption tax,” Mr. Rubio said in a November radio interview. He then turned a bit wistful. “I actually tried to do that in Florida,” he said, “with the property tax.”","year, time, like, new, think, way, come, long, change, want",us,politics
759,Trump Doubles Down on Potential Trade War With China - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that the United States would consider slapping tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods, escalating a potentially damaging trade dispute with Beijing. Mr. Trump said in a statement that he was responding to “unfair retaliation” by China, which published a list on Wednesday of $50 billion in American products that would be hit by tariffs, including soybeans and pork. That move was a direct reaction to the tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods that the White House detailed on Tuesday. “Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he had instructed the United States trade representative to determine whether tariffs on an additional $100 billion in goods were warranted and, “if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.” The announcement came one day after some of Mr. Trump’s advisers tried to calm markets and tamp down fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, saying that the tariff threats were the first step in a negotiation process. Mr. Trump said in his statement that the potential for new tariffs would not preclude discussions with the Chinese “to protect the technology and intellectual property of American companies and American people,” but any new tariffs are unlikely to make that already tough task easier. The move is a high-stakes gamble aimed at cowing China into backing down and forcing it to make the kinds of changes that the United States is seeking — namely reducing the coercive tactics American officials say Beijing uses to try to dominate leading-edge industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles. But the move could ultimately bring about the kind of retaliation from Beijing that has spooked stock markets. It also means that the United States would be somewhat more likely to place levies on Chinese products that American households routinely purchase, like furniture, clothing or shoes — an outcome the Trump administration said it sought to avoid with its initial round of tariffs. The president’s announcement was immediately criticized by manufacturers, retailers and politicians from states whose economies depend on agriculture. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said Mr. Trump was “threatening to light American agriculture on fire.” “Hopefully the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he’s even half-serious, this is nuts,” Mr. Sasse said. “Let’s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this.” A trade war could derail the current global economic expansion and cripple American businesses that depend on business with China. It could also further complicate geopolitical priorities given the Trump administration has enlisted the help of the Chinese in scheduling historic talks with North Korea next month. In a statement, Robert Lighthizer, the trade adviser who is carrying out an investigation into Chinese practices, described the president’s threat as “an appropriate response,” saying China should have responded to the initial tariffs levied by the United States by changing its behavior. On Friday, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce accused the United States of starting the conflict and said that “the Chinese position has been made very clear. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war.” He added that if the United States followed through with its threats, “The Chinese side will follow suit to the end and will not hesitate to pay any price and will definitely fight back. It must take a new comprehensive response and firmly defend the interests of the country and the people.” Mr. Trump’s effort to raise the stakes on Thursday seemed poised to send financial markets spinning, with futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500-index down and the yen climbing against the dollar. Markets were tame in Asia midday on Friday, which was a holiday in China. Companies potentially caught in the middle of a trade war called on the Trump administration to back down and try to work with the Chinese. “The announcement that the administration may issue $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese products is irresponsible and destabilizing,” said Dean C. Garfield, the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents companies such as Amazon, Apple and IBM. “We call on both sides to halt unproductive and escalatory rhetoric, recognizing that these words and actions have global consequences.” China experts have questioned whether Mr. Trump’s aggressive negotiating style will leave Chinese leaders with enough political room to make concessions to the Americans. Bowing to the president’s demands could be seen internally as weakness, and the changes that the administration wants — reducing China’s dominance in cutting-edge manufacturing and technology — is not something Beijing is likely to agree to. Wang Shouwen, China’s vice minister of commerce, has repeatedly refused to discuss curbing the Made in China 2025 industrial plan. The Trump administration contends that the program violates international trade rules that prohibit countries from using subsidies to help exporters and discourage imports. Mr. Wang and other officials deny that the program is in violation, but have provided few details on how it might comply. Including this most recent action, the United States would be placing tariffs on a total of $153 billion of Chinese products. The $100 billion threat came on top of the tariffs on $3 billion in Chinese steel and aluminum that he imposed last month and the tariffs on a further $50 billion in Chinese goods that he has threatened to impose in recent days. The total is now so large that China would have trouble finding enough American goods to penalize if it sought to impose a proportional retaliation. China bought only $130.4 billion worth of American goods last year, while the United States bought $505.6 billion worth of Chinese goods. The National Retail Federation blasted the move as a dangerous game of chicken that would put the United States on the losing end of a trading relationship that has benefited American companies and consumers. “This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerous downward spiral, and American families will be on the losing end,” Matthew R. Shay, the president and chief executive of the retail group, said in a statement. “We urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation’s economy.” The Chinese have tools other than tariffs at their disposal, including limiting the operations of American banks and other service providers in China. The government could also urge the Chinese public not to buy American-brand cars like Chevrolets and Fords, even though those are built almost entirely from Chinese-made parts and assembled in factories in China. The biggest question would be whether China would start retaliating not commercially but through geopolitical actions. While Trump administration trade officials appear to have been operating with considerable autonomy from those responsible for issues like North Korea and Taiwan, policymaking is much more unified in China. That means China could try to raise the temperature in the dispute by installing more military equipment on the artificial islands that it has recently built across the South China Sea, almost to the shores of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. China could also step up pressure on Taiwan. Beijing leaders are already deeply upset about recent congressional approval of the Taiwan Travel Act, which urged Mr. Trump to send administration officials to the self-governing island. Beijing regards Taiwan as a breakaway province, and has threatened to use force to reunite it. Chinese experts have made clear that they perceive the ever-larger rounds of American tariffs as part of a broad American challenge that goes beyond dollars and cents. “It is more than just a trade issue: It involves geopolitical reasons,” Wu Xinbo, the chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview this week. “Trump has mentioned before, if China doesn’t agree on economy and trade, the U.S. will reconsider China issues — that includes the South China Sea and Taiwan.” President Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to give a major speech on Tuesday at the Bo’ao Forum on the Chinese island of Hainan, which may give more clues to China’s response. The speech has been billed by other Chinese officials as a moment when Mr. Xi would lay out a blueprint for China’s economic overhaul and liberalization, a potential peace offering to the Trump administration, said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “President Trump’s move may throw a small monkey wrench into Xi’s plans,” Mr. Kennedy said. “He may now need to couple such a proposal with the warning that China will continue to defend itself against foreign pressure.”","United, States, country, government, China, american, official, Paris, Iran, deal",business,
4872,"Sex, Plagiarism and Spyware. This Is Not Your Average Copyright Complaint. - The New York Times","Emma Cline’s 2016 novel “The Girls” was, by any measure, a triumphant debut. The novel, which takes place in California in the 1960s and centers on a teenage girl who falls into a Charles Manson-like cult, sold to Random House for seven figures in a three-book deal, and spent three months on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Cline, who was 27 when the novel came out, was celebrated as a major new talent. But for the last two years, her success has been overshadowed, in private, by legal threats levied against her by a former boyfriend, Chaz Reetz-Laiolo. This week, that long simmering dispute became glaringly public, when Ms. Cline and Mr. Reetz-Laiolo filed dueling lawsuits in federal court in San Francisco. In his complaint, Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, who is also a writer, claims that Ms. Cline plagiarized phrases and scene structures from him that appear in “The Girls,” and used spyware to read his email and other personal documents. Ms. Cline’s publisher and Scott Rudin Productions, which optioned the screen rights to “The Girls,” are also named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages. Ms. Cline’s countersuit calls the claims “ludicrous,” and says that the suit was motivated by jealousy, and marks the culmination of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo’s continuing effort to threaten and intimidate her into paying him a large sum of money. Random House issued a statement in support of Ms. Cline, saying that “there is no basis to the plagiarism claims made by Mr. Reetz-Laiolo and we look forward to presenting our arguments in court.” Her literary agent, Bill Clegg, called the legal dispute “heartbreaking and enraging” in a statement provided to The New York Times, and noted that Ms. Cline was already developing the themes and framework for “The Girls” before she met Mr. Reetz-Laiolo. The complaint filed by Ms. Cline notes that many of the instances of overlapping phrases that Mr. Reetz-Laiolo contends were stolen from him are minimal and in some cases consist of only two words (like “heavy rear” and the word “Doomsville”). It argues that her use of spyware to read his emails was prompted by her suspicions that he was being unfaithful to her and not, as Mr. Reetz-Laiolo claims, as a way to surreptitiously read and copy his work. Ms. Cline’s lawyers have requested at least $75,000 in damages and asked that the copyright claims be dismissed. The unusual and dramatic legal clash over “The Girls” is far from a standard copyright complaint. There are high-powered lawyers representing both parties, in a convoluted dispute that includes accusations of physical and emotional abuse and charges of digital spying and invasion of privacy. Mr. Reetz-Laiolo is represented by Boies Schiller Flexner, which also represented the disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and helped him in his efforts to quash the sexual harassment allegations against him. Ms. Cline’s team of lawyers includes Carrie Goldberg, a prominent lawyer and advocate who specializes in representing women who have been victims of harassment and “revenge porn,” or online sexual shaming. (Ms. Goldberg is also representing the actress Paz de la Huerta, who has accused Mr. Weinstein of raping her and is bringing a criminal case against him.) The accusations leveled in Ms. Cline’s countersuit in many ways overshadow Mr. Reetz-Laiolo’s own claims that his intellectual property was taken, and suggest a pattern of intimidation, abuse and threats of public humiliation. The countersuit details alleged abusive behavior by Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, including a claim that in 2012, after reading a text message on her phone that he interpreted as flirtatious, he held her down on the bed and choked her so hard she could not breathe, and later threw her belongings into the street. (Ms. Cline appears to have recently referred to this episode, without naming Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, in an essay she wrote about sexual harassment for New York magazine.) In a statement provided to The Times by his lawyers, Mr. Reetz-Laiolo denied what he called “false accusations of physical abuse against me,” and said that Ms. Cline and her lawyers had not provided a defense against his claims of digital spying, as well as those of his co-plaintiffs, two women who were friends of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, who also say that Ms. Cline used spyware to read their emails. Ms. Cline’s countersuit contends that Mr. Reetz-Laiolo has repeatedly threatened to release embarrassing personal information about her. Ms. Cline, who grew up in Sonoma, Calif., met Mr. Reetz-Laiolo, then 33, in 2009, when she was a 20-year-old student at Middlebury College. Their relationship ended in 2012, but they stayed in touch. In the fall of 2014, after she had sold her novel to Random House, he told her that since she had become so successful, people might be interested in naked photographs of her that he had obtained when they were a couple, and that he was going to write a tell-all article about their relationship, Ms. Cline’s complaint says. An earlier draft of Mr. Reetz-Laiolo’s complaint included details about Ms. Cline’s personal life, taken from her old computer, which she had sold to him when they were still friendly. The complaint included screen shots of sexually explicit messages and details about her sexual fantasies, and threatened to expose her as the author of an erotic story she published online under a pseudonym. “Reetz-Laiolo has attempted to leverage this trove of personal data as a weapon to shame and falsely accuse Cline. And his allegations follow a pattern that started during their relationship — and apparently fits with the playbook of his counsel — of prying into and exploiting Cline’s sexual history to threaten her, even going so far as to make the false and absurd claim that she was an ‘escort,’” the countersuit says. The firm representing Mr. Reetz-Laiolo was co-founded by David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore in the United States Supreme Court case that followed the 2000 election. But more recently, Mr. Boies has come under scrutiny for his work representing Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Boies helped the producer hire a private investigation firm to undermine news articles about Mr. Weinstein’s sexual harassment and misconduct toward women, according to a report in The New Yorker. (The Boies firm has also provided legal counsel to The New York Times; the paper recently ended its relationship with him following the revelations of the work he did for Mr. Weinstein.) Mr. Boies’s name was at the top of an earlier draft of the complaint from May, which referred to Ms. Cline’s “use of her sexuality to extract compensation and manipulate older men.” The complaint featured screen shots of sexual explicit messages she had sent to past lovers, and used their names. Details from a second draft of the complaint were first reported by The New Yorker, which published an article about Mr. Boies’s involvement in the suit against Ms. Cline. The explicit material is not included in the filed complaint, and Mr. Boies is no longer listed as one of the lawyers. “The addition of the sexually explicit content in the second draft complaint served no purpose other than to coerce Emma into a settlement,” said Ms. Goldberg. “They were threatening to file this as a lawsuit, making it public, and that’s as good as saying we’re going to be disseminating this to the entire world.” Lawyers for Mr. Reetz-Laiolo counter that the details about her sexual past were made relevant to their copyright suit when Ms. Cline made issues of her own character and Mr. Reetz-Laiolo’s treatment of her. “Ms. Cline’s lawyers are attempting to manipulate the important national conversation about sexual harassment to muddy the clear case of Ms. Cline’s plagiarism and illegal activity,” Boies Schiller Flexner said in a statement. “We addressed this topic only in response, and then only in confidential communications with Ms. Cline’s lawyers.” To Ms. Cline and her lawyers, the inclusion of such material in legal communication appeared to be a thinly veiled threat that she would face public humiliation unless a settlement was reached. “What should have been a happy milestone — publishing my first novel — has turned into a yearslong nightmare perpetrated by someone I believed I had finally escaped from,” Ms. Cline said in a statement to The Times. “My only experience of publishing a novel has been one where I am under acute attack, with my sexual history weaponized against me by a cadre of male lawyers. I’ll never be able to get back the years I’ve now spent responding to an ex-boyfriend’s baseless legal assaults and ludicrous, billion-dollar claims instead of writing another book. That’s a loss I don’t know how to fully comprehend.”","woman, write, story, New, book, news, medium, York, work, television",books,
2770,Fact-Checking President Trump Through His First 100 Days - The New York Times,"In his first 100 days in office, President Trump has falsely boasted of attracting the largest inaugural crowd ever, cited a nonexistent terrorist attack in Sweden and leveled an unproved accusation that his predecessor spied on him. While these inaccuracies have commanded much attention, there has been a steady stream of falsehoods. The Times has logged at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days (Saturday is Day 100). On five days, Mr. Trump went golfing, and on two he made limited public statements. Here’s an assessment. Mr. Trump overstated his support. While his victory certainly surprised many, in the general election Mr. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. On his first full day in office, Mr. Trump visited C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia and criticized news media accounts of his inaugural crowd. Independent estimates, many based on photographic evidence, are nowhere near as high, peaking at a third of the 1.8 million people who attended President Barack Obama’s 2009 inaugural. Mr. Trump took to Twitter the next day to defend his speech to the C.I.A. While the audience applauded several times during the speech, Mr. Trump neglects to mention that the agents never sat down. Former intelligence officers say that C.I.A. employees will not sit unless instructed to do so. Mr. Obama gestured for agents to be seated in his first speech to the agency in 2009 (about a minute into the video), but Mr. Trump did not do so. Mr. Trump can claim two environmental awards, according to PolitiFact. One thanks him personally for donating land to the New York State park system, which never turned the land into a state park. The other was awarded to his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., which was later cited by the state for environmental violations. Mr. Trump took executive actions to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, but his job figures lack context. The State Department estimated that the Keystone pipeline would support 42,000 temporary jobs while being built over two years, about 3,900 in construction. After the project is completed, the pipeline is expected to employ 35 people permanently. In his first major TV interview as president, Mr. Trump repeated numerous falsehoods, including his claims of wide-scale voter fraud. Investigations have turned up no evidence of this. A day before he issued an executive order restricting travel from seven countries and temporarily halting refugee admissions, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that refugees enter the country without scrutiny. A vetting system has existed since the 1980s and was modified after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Refugees undergo multiple rounds of background checks from several federal agencies, in a process that can take up to two years. Mr. Trump tweeted this claim 47 minutes after Mr. Phillips, who helped create an app to report voter fraud, appeared on CNN and argued without evidence that three million people had cast illegal votes. Several prominent studies and election watchers from both parties contradict Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Phillips’s claims of mass voter fraud. This Twitter post is false. The Times’s publisher and executive editor wrote a letter on Nov. 13 thanking readers for their loyalty and praising the newsroom for covering the 2016 election “with agility and creativity.” Nowhere in the letter does The Times apologize. After a federal judge blocked his “extreme vetting” executive order and nationwide protests were held, Mr. Trump issued a statement defending the order with a superficial comparison to a previous policy that was narrower in scope and in response to a specific episode. According to news reports, Mr. Obama’s State Department temporarily stopped processing refugee applications from Iraq in 2011 after two Iraqi refugees were arrested on charges of trying to send money and supplies to Al Qaeda. But records from the State Department show that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011. Mr. Trump continued to offer misleading defenses of his travel ban. Mr. Trump is referring to the number of people traveling midair and detained at airports when his executive order was announced on Jan. 27, but Delta’s outage did not occur until 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 29. More than 1,000 others were denied boarding from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, and tens of thousands of visas were temporarily revoked. Mr. Trump’s figure on pharmaceutical products comes from a 2014 study by a center affiliated with Tufts University and financed by drug companies. Some have questioned the study’s lack of methodological transparency and reliance on assumptions. Mr. Trump’s Twitter criticism of a refugee agreement between the United States and Australia, which followed a contentious phone call with that country’s prime minister, lacks context. Mr. Obama agreed to accept refugees held in processing centers — about 1,250, not “thousands.” The United States would conduct its own assessment of whom to resettle in the country, and those who entered would have legal refugee status. After Iran conducted a missile test, Mr. Trump delivered a misleading message on Twitter. The $150 billion figure refers to a high estimate for Iranian assets previously frozen under sanctions and freed up in exchange for Iran’s giving up its pursuit of nuclear weapons. In other words, it is money that already belongs to Iran, and some of it is tied up in debt obligations. Protests against Mr. Trump’s executive order continued into a second weekend, prompting Mr. Trump to claim with no evidence that demonstrators were paid agitators. Dubai’s police deputy tweeted support for the travel ban, while other key Muslim nations were silent. But Iran, Sudan and Iraq, three of the seven countries targeted by the ban, expressed concern, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation called upon the United States to “reconsider this blanket decision” and “maintain its moral obligation.” Defending President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a Fox News interview with Bill O’Reilly, Mr. Trump said the United States has “made a lot of mistakes” as well, though he has always opposed the Iraq war. This claim has been repeatedly debunked. In September 2002, asked by the radio personality Howard Stern if America should go to war, Mr. Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.” He did not oppose the Iraq war publicly until after the invasion. During a speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, Mr. Trump falsely accused the news media of not covering terrorist attacks. The White House later released a list of 78 terrorist attacks it deemed underreported, including prominent attacks in Berlin and Nice, France. The media, including The Times, had covered all but one: a claimed Oct. 15 attack in Egypt that had been referred to in an anonymous blog. Mr. Trump inaccurately described the trend in the murder rate, which was much higher in the 1990s. This is cherry-picked. Mr. Trump linked to an Emerson College poll in which 48 percent called him dishonest compared with 53 percent for the news media. In other polls, a majority of respondents have characterized Mr. Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy. According to Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and several others, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who was then still awaiting confirmation to the Supreme Court, called Mr. Trump’s attacks on a federal judge “demoralizing.” This led Mr. Trump to falsely claim media bias on Twitter. Mr. Blumenthal’s misrepresentation of his military service, reported by The Times in 2010, was part of the first question posed by Mr. Cuomo, a CNN anchor. Mr. Trump’s morning Twitter complaint is misleading. The Times published a story in print on Feb. 10 about the relationship between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump and did include the line Mr. Trump quoted. The two leaders spoke on the phone the evening of Feb. 9, after the story had gone to press. Online, the story was updated and stated the evening phone call was the first time they had spoken since Nov. 14. Mr. Trump promised his negotiating skills would help drive down the cost of a wall at the Mexican border, citing his role in shaving $728 million off the cost of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. Mr. Trump may have sped up the process, but costs were decreasing before he got involved. The Air Force projected about $600 million in savings on Dec. 19, two days before Mr. Trump met with Lockheed’s chief executive. This Tweet is false. Local media reported about the crowds that lined the roads as Mr. Trump traveled from his Mar-a-Lago resort, where he was hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, to the airport. Most of these people were protesters, not supporters. Speaking about trade at a news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Trump overstated his role in several companies’ investment and job creation plans. Ford’s decision to cancel its new factory in Mexico and Intel’s resuming a plant operation in Arizona that was conceived in 2011 were a consequence of market demand, according to the companies. General Motors and Fiat Chrysler both announced $1 billion investment plans that they say were years in the making. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been increases in the number of reported cases of autism, but this may be because of an increase in awareness, diagnoses and changes in the definition of autism. During a listening session with retail executives, Mr. Trump talked about an executive order cutting regulations and cited a figure found in research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers. These findings are disputed and criticized for flawed methodology and for ignoring the economic benefits of regulation. Aggregate analysis from the Office of Budget and Management from 2005 to 2015 found that the benefits of new rules outweighed the cost. Mr. Trump uttered numerous misleading and false claims during his first news conference, including an inaccurate characterization of staggering job losses. The Bureau of Labor Statistics had reported job growth for 76 straight months at the time of his statement. In his weekly address, Mr. Trump misleadingly suggested his executive order rolled back a regulation that would have prevented coal mining from polluting streams. But there is no evidence that the rule threatened a significant number of coal mining jobs, or that rolling it back would create new ones. Coal mining jobs have been on the decline since the 1980s. Mr. Trump held a campaign-style rally in Florida, and ticked off a list of places that had experienced terrorist attacks including Brussels, Nice and Sweden. Nothing like a terrorist attack happened in Sweden the night before or of Mr. Trump’s rally. Seeking to clarify his claim, Mr. Trump offered a misleading defense. The Fox News segment he alluded to was about a reported surge in crime in Sweden linked to immigrants, but the police officer interviewed in the segment says his comments were taken out of context. Sweden processed a record number of asylum applications in 2015. The nation’s crime prevention council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Over all, it said, there was no significant increase in crime. As he toured the Museum of African-American History and Culture, Mr. Trump was asked to denounce anti-Semitism and claimed he always does so. Five days earlier, Mr. Trump was asked by a reporter for an Orthodox magazine about his efforts to address anti-Semitism. Mr. Trump told the reporter to sit down and said he was the “least anti-Semitic person” ever, but did not denounce anti-Semitism. Staking out his priorities in a budget meeting, Mr. Trump gave an incomplete characterization of the military. Top military officers have raised questions about the readiness of the Army, with exhausted troops and some outdated supplies. Still, the United States military is the most powerful in the world, and its military spending outstrips that of the next seven nations combined. Mr. Trump inaccurately described his administration’s deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants as unprecedented at a meeting with manufacturing executives. The Obama administration deported them at a record pace. During his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump ran through familiar critiques of the media and inaccuracies. Only one of the unions representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees endorsed him. The numbers in this morning Twitter message are accurate, but it’s a stretch for Mr. Trump to take credit for a 0.06 percent decline in the federal debt. The dip is a temporary and normal fluctuation that doesn’t negate the long-term trend of rising debt. And it is more accurately a reflection of the policies of Mr. Obama. Weighing in on the results of the election for Democratic National Committee chairman, Mr. Trump tweeted with no evidence that the contest had been rigged. Hillary Clinton did not formally endorse Tom Perez, the former secretary of labor and winner of the race, and both he and Senator Bernie Sanders rejected Mr. Trump’s claim. Among several of Mr. Trump’s inaccurate statements about the Affordable Care Act during a meeting with insurance executives was this distortion of those without coverage. The Internal Revenue Service estimated that 6.5 million people paid the penalty in 2015. About 12.7 million others qualified for exemptions. This characterization of the financial recovery is exaggerated. In terms of G.D.P. increase and job growth, the recovery from the 2007 recession is the second worst of the 11 recoveries since 1948, behind the 2001 recovery. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump made one public statement on Twitter, “THANK YOU!” Speaking aboard the supercarrier Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Trump overstated his defense budget increase. There have been at least 10 military spending increases since the 1977 fiscal year larger than his requested 10 percent increase, and 27 since 1940, if war funding is factored in. This comparison, which Mr. Trump made in his weekly address, is misleading. The Navy had a total battle force of 275 ships in September 2016, which is the smallest it has been since 1916 but also far more powerful. Comparing the forces of the past and today is “like comparing the telegraph to the smartphone; they’re just not comparable,” Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy in the Obama administration, said in 2012. Mr. Trump offered this infamous accusation about his predecessor without providing any evidence in an early-morning Twitter post, and has yet to do so after weeks of obfuscation. Top intelligence officials and political leaders in both parties reject his claim. The next day, Mr. Trump repeated his claim, again without offering evidence. In a congratulatory Facebook message to Exxon Mobil, Mr. Trump once again took undue credit for auto companies’ jobs and investment plans, many of which were announced or in the works before his election. Of the 714 former detainees transferred to other countries by Jan. 15,  121 are confirmed to have engaged in militant activity since their release. However, of the 121 men, 113 were transferred under President George W. Bush, not Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump posted a screenshot of a Fox Business Network segment and overstated his role in job growth in early 2017. The jobs report is based on payroll data collected through the week of the 12th of each month. Mr. Trump had been in office for less than a month at that point. The report also noted that mild weather contributed to a record high number of construction jobs. Painting an overly rosy picture of reactions to his bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump excoriated reporting on the fallout. The press, The Times included, reported on widespread opposition to Mr. Trump’s bill, including among Republicans. Research shows less than a million people ended up with no insurance at all. Affordable Care Act premiums have spiked and the marketplace isn’t as competitive or abundant with choice as anticipated. But “imploding” goes too far. Evidence suggests the market is far from collapsing and is, in fact, stabilizing. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump made no public appearances or remarks. This is false. About 20 million have gained insurance because of the heath care law. Mr. Trump posted a screenshot of a Fox Business Network segment about the February jobs report. Job growth was healthy, but Mr. Trump’s role in it is not so clear-cut. The estimate came three weeks into his presidency. Blaming Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) for manufacturing job losses since 1994, as Mr. Trump did in Detroit, ignores other, arguably more important factors like automation, gains in productivity and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Speaking at a Friends of Ireland luncheon, Mr. Trump recited a “proverb” that he inaccurately suggested was Irish. The quotation’s origins are disputed, but it does not hail from the Irish. PolitiFact reported that some have attributed it to a Nigerian poet, who may not exist. The couplet also appears in a 2003 book of poetry by a Texas author and a 1936 volume of the “International Stereotypers’ and Electrotypers’ Union Journal.” Mr. Trump emphasized the need to reform health care by cherry-picking the highest premium increases in the country. In 2017, premiums for the benchmark plan increased by 22 percent on average. Some places had higher increases (116 percent in Arizona, the only state in triple digits) and some lower (9 percent in Wyoming). Following a news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Trump tweeted a misleading critique of Germany’s NATO obligations. While Germany does fall short of allocating 2 percent of its G.D.P. to military spending, that money is not intended to be paid to NATO or the United States. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump went golfing. Mr. Trump overstated the trade deficit. The United States had a total goods trade deficit of $750 billion in 2016, but a services trade surplus of $250 billion — a net deficit of $500 billion. Mr. Trump’s presidential directive requiring the use of American steel in pipelines applies only to new projects. Construction for the two pipelines had already begun, and the executive orders greenlighting them do not require use of American steel. Mr. Trump repeated this claim during a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. From 2000 to 2014, the United States spent about $1.6 trillion on the wars, according to the Congressional Research Service. Mr. Trump’s $6 trillion figure also encompasses the cost of nation-building and future spending on veterans’ health care and disability. In his interview with Time magazine, Mr. Trump refused to back down from his wiretapping accusation and falsely claimed The Times had altered a headline that supported him. The Times article does use the word “wiretap,” but it does not support Mr. Trump’s assertion that Mr. Obama ordered phones at Trump Tower wiretapped. At no point was the headline altered. Mr. Trump often promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act “immediately” and listed it as a legislative priority in his 100-day plan. Evidence suggests the market is far from “exploding” and is, in fact, stabilizing. A variation on one of his most repeated claims, Mr. Trump again took outsize credit for savings in a contract for F-35 fighter jets. The Defense Department announced $600 million in cuts before Mr. Trump had jumped into the negotiation project. After the F.B.I. director confirmed that the agency is investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, Mr. Trump pointed the finger at Hillary and Bill Clinton. His uranium claim is misleading. The State Department under Mrs. Clinton was one of nine government agencies that had to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a company with uranium assets in the United States. There is no evidence Mrs. Clinton personally lobbied to greenlight the deal. In signing an executive order to undo Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, Mr. Trump misleadingly claimed the action would lead to energy independence. The Clean Power Plan regulates carbon emissions from power plants, most of which are fueled by natural gas or coal. But the United States has been exporting more coal than it has imported for the past decade and is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2018. Again, this Twitter claim is false. The Times did not apologize in its letter. Mr. Trump linked to a New York Post column that argued that a Jan. 20 article in The Times validated his accusation that Mr. Obama had wiretapped him. This is false. Mr. Trump again touted many companies’ job creation plans as a direct result of his election, but many of the investments were planned or announced before the election. The Fox News report, which was based on one anonymous source, is not evidence for Mr. Trump’s initial accusation that Mr. Obama spied on him. When Americans are caught in surveillance of foreign targets, their names are typically hidden unless a top official asks for the names to be revealed or “unmasked.” This does not mean that the names were leaked publicly. In an interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Trump continued to insist falsely that he had been validated because he meant “wiretapped” in a broad sense. Mr. Trump did use the word “wiretap” in quote marks in two Twitter posts, but he specifically accused Mr. Obama of ordering his phones to be tapped in two other posts. At a meeting with the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Mr. Trump again exaggerated his defense budget request. Mr. Trump uttered versions of this claim twice in the same day, and it is misleading. The United States reported an overall trade deficit of about $92 billion in the first two months of 2017, which is on par with the last two months of 2016. Mr. Trump may have been referring to reports that the trade deficit declined by 9.6 percent from January to February of this year, but month-to-month fluctuations are common. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Trump accused Ms. Rice, the former national security adviser, of a crime with no evidence. A conservative writer and conspiracy theorist who did not identify his sources said that Ms. Rice sought to learn the identities of Trump associates swept up in surveillance of foreign officials. Leaking the names would be a crime; there is no evidence that Ms. Rice did so. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump again claimed undue credit for over $728 million in savings on F-35 fighter jets. Border apprehensions, the best gauge for border crossings, declined 64 percent from March 2016 to March 2017. But Mr. Trump’s statement gives the impression that he was talking about a month-to-month decrease, which was about 35 percent from February to March 2017. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump went golfing. Following stories about a rift between Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, and other White House staff members, Mr. Trump falsely claimed to have not known Mr. Bannon before his campaign. He has known Mr. Bannon since 2011. Mr. Trump said he had known Mr. Bannon “for many years” in a 2016 campaign statement. A personnel shortage is largely his own doing, even by his own account. As of the day of his interview, Mr. Trump had yet to nominate anyone for 478 positions out of more than 533 key appointments. He told Fox News in February he didn’t want to appoint “because they’re unnecessary to have.” During a meeting with emergency medical workers, Mr. Trump boasted that he had done more against the Islamic State than Mr. Obama had in a fraction of the time. Under the Obama administration, a military coalition recaptured several major cities from the Islamic State and launched more than 17,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Islamic State had lost no major cities, and the coalition had conducted about 2,000 airstrikes. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump went golfing. No false or misleading statements. Tens of thousands across the country took to the streets as part of Tax March to demand Mr. Trump’s tax returns, which he has not released. Ezra Levin, a member of Tax March’s executive committee, called Mr. Trump’s tweet “bogus and flat-out false.” This is false. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to declare China a currency manipulator, and he labeled China that in an interview with The Financial Times in early April. But he told The Wall Street Journal later that month that he would no longer do so. The gang in question, Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, precedes Mr. Obama’s presidency by decades. By 2005, four years before Mr. Obama took office, the F.B.I. reported that MS-13 had 10,000 “hardcore members” active, the same number cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the day of Mr. Trump’s claim. This tweet about the results of the special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District is exaggerated. Votes for Democratic and Republican candidates were nearly even for the House seat vacated by Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s new health secretary. A two-candidate runoff to fill the seat will be held in June. Mr. Trump accused Iran of not adhering to the Iran nuclear deal a day after his State Department confirmed that Tehran was complying. Mr. Trump later clarified that he was referring to Iran’s activities in the Middle East and the world, but he did not offer this context with his original statement. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Trump misleadingly suggested NATO had changed after he accused it of not focusing on terrorism, and cited a Wall Street Journal article from June 2016 about the alliance’s creation of a new counterterrorism position. NATO has been engaged in counterterrorism efforts since 1980, and the position isn’t considered a significant step. No false or misleading statements. Mr. Trump falsely suggested on Twitter that he had beaten Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote. In the April ABC/Washington Post poll referred to by Mr. Trump, 46 percent of voters said they voted for Mrs. Clinton and 43 percent for Mr. Trump. This is similar to Mrs. Clinton’s popular-vote margin from November. Mr. Trump’s border wall would not address several modes of drug trafficking from Mexican criminal networks. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2016 report, the most common method of transporting drugs is in concealed compartments in vehicles crossing ports of entry. Other methods rely on tunnels, drones and commercial cargo trains and buses. None of these methods would be prevented by a wall. There are at least a dozen countries that have trade deficits with the United States, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil and Egypt. Judge William H. Orrick of the United States District Court blocked Mr. Trump’s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities. While he is in California, the same state as the Ninth Circuit, he does not sit on the Ninth. On the eve of a potential government shutdown, Mr. Trump misleadingly accused Democrats of having no qualms about letting government-funded health care benefits for coal miners lapse unless funding is extended by April 30. But the senator who introduced legislation extending funding is Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia. Among his 26 co-sponsors are 14 other Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont, who caucuses with the party. On the eve of his first 100 days in office, Mr. Trump claimed unprecedented progress. Of course, any productivity comparison is subjective, but his claim is off by a few metrics. During Mr. Trump’s first 90 days in office, he signed 28 bills into law and the Senate confirmed his nominee for Supreme Court justice. Mr. Trump had not signed into law any of the 10 pieces of major legislation in his 100-day plan. The White House has also pointed to Mr. Trump’s rollback of Obama-era regulations. At the same point, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had signed 76 bills into law, Mr. Obama had enacted a stimulus package and President George W. Bush had enacted major tax cuts.","Trump, Obama, president, Bush, White, House, President, campaign, adviser, Carson",us,politics
3623,Trump’s Communications Orbit - The New York Times,"President Trump may be the White House communicator-in-chief, but he still relies on a number of associates, both inside the West Wing and on the sidelines, to spar with reporters and amplify his message. With the arrival of Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer’s abrupt departure and the quick promotion of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Trump message machine looks a bit different now. Here’s a rundown of the people in the president’s messaging orbit. As a Goldman Sachs financier, Mr. Scaramucci may have the least communications experience of any of the president’s aides. But his never-give-an-inch defense of Mr. Trump since before the election has endeared him to the man in the Oval Office. He was a frequent presence at Trump Tower during the transition, often appearing before the throng of reporters in the lobby. And since the inauguration, he has been all over television, defending Mr. Trump and his agenda. Loyal to Mr. Trump and to Mr. Spicer, Ms. Sanders has increasingly become the voice of the administration, her Southern twang broadcast by cable networks after audio-only briefings during the past several weeks. The daughter of Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate, Ms. Sanders has repeatedly been forced to try to explain the president’s contradictory or false statements to a skeptical press corps. A frequent response: “I’ll get back to you.” A more frequent presence on TV earlier in the president’s term, Ms. Conway remains an important part of Mr. Trump’s communications apparatus, behind closed doors and on camera. Her infamous comments about “alternative facts” and other public relations blunders kept her off the air for a while, but she has returned to doing interviews and remains the staunchest of the president’s defenders. She rarely appears on TV and is almost never quoted, but Ms. Hicks may be the most important person in the communications orbit — she controls access to the president and is ever-present in the moments when Mr. Trump engages the news media. Her relationship with the president gives her the enviable ability to freelance, sometimes to the frustration of others in the West Wing, including other members of the communications team and Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. The anonymous author of a series of pro-Trump essays during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Anton has become the person responsible for managing Mr. Trump’s foreign policy and national security message. That can be tricky business, especially when it comes to navigating the Russia relationship amid the continuing investigations into that country’s meddling in the United States election.  A highly visible defender of Mr. Trump’s agenda, Mr. Gorka has long grabbed headlines for his aggressive commentary on behalf of his boss. An American citizen who was born in Britain to Hungarian parents, Mr. Gorka was once an editor for the far-right Breitbart News and is a friend of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist.  A former public relations specialist in Hollywood, Mr. Raffel has become the principal spokesman for Mr. Kushner, the senior adviser to Mr. Trump and the president’s son-in-law. While not frequently quoted, Mr. Raffel is often the primary route for delivering Mr. Kushner’s message to the news media and he also handles communications on issues like Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and paid family leave which are part of Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump’s, portfolio.  He was once in the official camp, but since leaving the transition for personal reasons, Mr. Miller has become one of Mr. Trump’s ardent cadre of television talking heads. He is a specialist when it comes to describing the president’s actions in the best possible light, rarely accepting criticism. Instead, he engages in public relations combat. Combative and fiery, Mr. Lewandowski was the most aggressive defender of the president while he headed up the 2016 campaign. After being replaced in a shake-up, he faded into the background but never really left the president’s orbit. During the transition, Mr. Lewandowski set up shop in Washington, leading to speculation that he might rejoin the official communications team. He has not, but he remains a staunch defender. A longtime friend of the president’s, Mr. Ruddy is one of the extended group of people who whisper in Mr. Trump’s ear and sometimes talk to the news media about what the president is thinking. Several times, Mr. Ruddy has appeared to go beyond what Mr. Trump might have liked, speaking to reporters about turmoil in the president’s staff and then drawing anger from Mr. Spicer and others in the White House. A longtime conservative legal scholar, Mr. Sekulow is now the chief spokesman for the president’s legal team as it relates to the sprawling Russia investigation. In repeated appearances on television in recent weeks, Mr. Sekulow has parried with aggressive reporters and has sought to explain the president’s tweets about the investigations.","Trump, Obama, president, Bush, White, House, President, campaign, adviser, Carson",us,politics
4655,Key Takeaways From Tuesday’s Elections - The New York Times,"By any measure, Tuesday was a big night for Democrats, especially in Virginia, where they swept the top offices, including governor, and made strong gains in the General Assembly. Here are some key takeaways from the biggest election night since President Trump’s victory a year ago. It was largely a suburban rebellion, where more moderate voters rejected Mr. Trump and embraced Democrats. Be it New Jersey, Virginia or Charlotte, N.C., Democrats rode a miniwave of victories that will give them energy for candidate recruitment and fund-raising heading into the midterm elections next year. In addition to winning the top races, for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats also captured the mayoral post in Manchester, N.H., the State Senate in Washington, along with other important victories in statehouse elections. Maine also became the first state to vote to expand Medicaid, the 32nd in all under President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, tried his best to sound the call of Mr. Trump’s followers in stoking the nation’s culture wars. He was harsh on immigration, supportive of Confederate monuments and opposed to those N.F.L. players who have taken a knee. But his public record before, as a national party chairman, White House counselor and Washington lobbyist, had few of those harsh edges. And like a lot of Republicans, he only grudgingly supported Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Most notably, Mr. Gillespie did not seek to campaign with the president in Virginia, settling for support via Twitter. That left him with almost all of Mr. Trump’s baggage and few potential benefits. Mr. Trump, traveling in Asia, said that Mr. Gillespie’s problem may well have been not embracing him enough. The president’s approval rating in Virginia was 38 percent in one recent poll, and he lost the state to Hillary Clinton by more than five percentage points. Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter endorsing Mr. Gillespie several weeks ago, then added a few more on Election Day. But with the stain of losing, Mr. Trump quickly cut ties. The suburbs of Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C., are now undeniably the most important region of the state politically. Wealthy and well-educated, the counties have rapidly become strongly Democratic, and population projections for the state indicate the areas will continue to far outpace more rural and Republican areas in growth. The counties in Northern Virginia are broadly diverse. Prince William County now has more minorities than it does whites. The white population in Loudoun County has dropped almost 30 percentage points since 2000, and Asians are now the largest minority group, at 17 percent. Hard-line Republican policies on immigration have helped drive immigrant voters to Democrats. Couple that with suburban women gravitating to the party, and it is a coalition so large in number that it is difficult to beat. Republicans have not won statewide in Virginia since 2009. The next major test will be the Senate race in 2018, when Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate last year, will seek a second term. His prospects now look much better. Progressives who did not enthusiastically back Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, will be rethinking their theory of the race. Mr. Northam had a résumé that fit the profile of his state. He is an Army veteran, a physician and a moderate politically. He was, in a word, electable. That does not mean the friction between the institutional party Democrats and those in the Bernie Sanders wing will fade. But the lesson from Virginia is that those fights in the primary are fine as long as each side coalesces behind the nominee. Mr. Northam defeated former Representative Tom Perriello, who was favored by progressives. But Mr. Perriello worked energetically for Mr. Northam’s election. Mr. Northam’s voice may have gone down easy in the vast southwestern part of Virginia, but there was no political affinity. While many Democrats have argued that their party needs to work to regain the support of rural white voters, the results in Virginia, at least, show that those efforts may be futile. But there was a notable exception. Mr. Northam won in Virginia Beach, a traditionally Republican area, showing perhaps that the backlash against Trumpism could extend to parts of the military population that dominates that region. With a convincing, if expected, victory for governor of New Jersey, Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker, brought an emphatic end to the Chris Christie era. The Garden State now joins six other states that have Democrats in control of the legislative and executive branches. Mr. Murphy managed to persuade voters of his transformation from wealthy deal maker to progressive Democrat, and he has vowed to make his state a firewall against the policies of Mr. Trump. Now comes the hard part for Mr. Murphy, a relative political novice. Will he be able to deliver on his promises? With Democrats controlling the legislature, the burden will be even higher for him to deliver.","Clinton, campaign, candidate, voter, republican, party, election, state, vote, Cruz",us,politics
6290,Baylor Demotes President Kenneth Starr Over Handling of Sex Assault Cases - The New York Times,"Kenneth W. Starr, the former independent counsel who delivered a report that served as the basis for President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, was removed as president of Baylor University on Thursday after an investigation found the university mishandled accusations of sexual assault against football players. The university also fired the football coach, Art Briles, whose ascendant program brought in millions of dollars in revenue but was dogged by accusations of sexual assault committed by its players — an increasingly familiar combination in big-time college sports. Mr. Starr was stripped of his title as university president but will remain Baylor’s chancellor and a professor at the law school. The chancellor position is “centered around development and religious liberty,” a regent said on a conference call Thursday afternoon, adding that Mr. Starr’s “operational responsibilities have been removed.” Mr. Starr’s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report by an outside law firm commissioned by the university’s governing board, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them. “We were horrified by the extent of these acts of sexual violence on our campus,” Richard Willis, chairman of Baylor’s Board of Regents, said in a statement. “This investigation revealed the University’s mishandling of reports in what should have been a supportive, responsive and caring environment for students.” Mr. Starr said in a statement to news organizations: “I join the Board of Regents and the Senior Administration of the University in expressing heartfelt contrition for the tragedy and sadness that has unfolded. To those victims who were not treated with the care, concern, and support they deserve, I am profoundly sorry.” Violence against women on college campuses has risen as a national conversation in recent years, and one particular thread has been whether athletes in big-time sports like football and basketball are afforded favorable treatment by universities and communities that come together to support and protect successful teams. Critics have said that Baylor sacrificed moral considerations — and the safety of other students — for the sake of its winning football team. The investigation said as much, describing the flouting of federal gender-equity law and rebuking a university leadership that “created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.” In one instance, according to a summary of the investigation released by the board, university administrators discouraged an accuser in a manner that “constituted retaliation against a complainant for reporting sexual assault.” What investigations did occur, the summary said, “were conducted in the context of a broader culture and belief by many administrators that sexual violence ‘doesn’t happen here.’” Mr. Starr, who was solicitor general and a federal judge before taking on the Clinton case, has been credited with raising hundreds of millions of dollars for Baylor, the country’s largest Baptist university, in part by yoking its fortunes to football. Much fund-raising was centered on building a gleaming on-campus home field, McLane Stadium, which opened in 2014, the same year that Mr. Starr added the title of chancellor to his role as president. “Let me be clear,” Mr. Starr wrote in a public letter in February: “Sexual violence emphatically has no place whatsoever at Baylor University.” That Baylor had an apparently functioning athletic department was seen as an achievement in itself: The university experienced one of the worst college sports scandals ever after a men’s basketball player murdered a teammate in 2003, with a subsequent investigation revealing drug use and payments to players, resulting in harsh N.C.A.A. penalties. Baylor said it had retained a law firm for the possibility of an N.C.A.A. investigation into the latest transgressions. The circumstances took on a new dimension nearly a year ago, when a former football player, Sam Ukwuachu, was convicted of sexually assaulting another Baylor athlete and sentenced to six months in jail. During the trial, a former girlfriend of Mr. Ukwuachu’s testified that he had assaulted her several years earlier, when he had been a football player at Boise State. Baylor denied that it had been apprised of Mr. Ukwuachu’s history; Boise State disputed that denial. The Ukwuachu case came a year after Tevin Elliott, a former Baylor player, was convicted of sexually assaulting a Baylor freshman. Two other Baylor students testified that Mr. Elliott had also sexually assaulted them. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Subsequent news reports have found several other accusations of sexual assault by Baylor athletes, including one against two players that Baylor did not investigate for more than two years. After Mr. Ukwuachu’s conviction, Mr. Starr chose Baylor’s faculty athletics representative, a former federal prosecutor, to lead an inquiry into the university’s handling of Mr. Ukwuachu. A week later, based on that investigation, Mr. Starr recommended that Baylor’s board hire outside lawyers to conduct another investigation. Soon, Baylor announced that the Regents had retained two lawyers from Pepper Hamilton to conduct a “thorough and independent and external investigation.” Pepper Hamilton, a firm based in Philadelphia, said it reviewed more than one million documents and conducted 65 interviews, including with “individuals who identified as victims/survivors of sexual assault or dating violence.” Such investigations are sometimes cited by defendants in Title IX lawsuits as proof that the university did not possess “deliberate indifference” to a problem of sexual assault, according to Erin Buzuvis, a Title IX expert and a law professor at Western New England University. Some courts, Ms. Buzuvis said, “might put a little more teeth on that requirement.” Baylor settled a lawsuit by an accuser of Mr. Ukwuachu’s last year, while one by an accuser of Mr. Elliott’s was filed earlier this year. The Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights is investigating nearly 200 postsecondary institutions under Title IX over sexual violence cases, but as of Thursday, Baylor was not among them. Athletic Director Ian McCaw was placed on probation, the board said, while Mr. Briles was suspended with intention to terminate. Several news media reports said the football team’s defensive coordinator, Phil Bennett, would serve as interim head coach. Mr. Willis, the board’s chairman, said on the conference call that Pepper Hamilton’s findings had nothing “specific” to implicate Mr. Bennett. Mr. Briles, a Texas lifer, was one of the most successful coaches in college football — and one of the best paid, with an annual salary of nearly $6 million, according to USA Today (as a private university, Baylor is not required to make such figures public). Formerly Houston’s head coach, Mr. Briles installed an unorthodox, wide-open offense and built the Bears, historically a football also-ran in a state dominated by larger neighbors like Texas and Texas A&M, into a powerhouse. In 2011, quarterback Robert Griffin III won the program’s first Heisman Trophy — a statue of Griffin, now with the Cleveland Browns, graces the front entrance to McLane Stadium — and the team won or shared the Big 12 title in 2013 and 2014. The allegations in the Baylor report are similar to others that have surfaced at universities with prominent athletics programs. Florida State’s Heisman-winning quarterback Jameis Winston was accused of rape in 2012 (he denied the charge) and was not disciplined by the university after an incomplete police investigation and a hearing. At Tennessee, a lawsuit  filed this year partially blamed a noncompliant climate for sexual assaults by five athletes. Despite a Department of Education letter in 2011 advising colleges to have detailed, appropriate guidelines for handling accusations of sexual assault, Baylor did not appoint a full-time Title IX coordinator until late 2014, according to the investigation. In 1985, Baylor received a partial exemption to Title IX for several policies that it said conflicted with its sincerely held religious beliefs, such as condemnation of “premarital unchastity.” The report released on Thursday found that Baylor’s religiously informed outlook on drug use, alcohol and premarital sex made accusers fearful of coming forward.","police, officer, charge, case, prosecutor, arrest, prison, year, crime, man",sports,ncaafootball
3034,"Ariana Grande Manchester Concert Ends in Explosion, Panic and Death - The New York Times","MANCHESTER, England — An explosion that appeared to be a suicide bombing killed at least 22 people on Monday night and wounded 59 others at an Ariana Grande concert filled with adoring adolescent fans, in what the police were treating as a terrorist attack. Panic and mayhem seized the crowd at the Manchester Arena as the blast reverberated through the building, just as the show was ending and pink balloons were dropping from the rafters in a signature flourish by Ms. Grande, a 23-year-old American pop star on an international tour. Traumatized concertgoers, including children separated from parents, screamed and fled what appeared to be the deadliest episode of terrorism in Britain since the 2005 London transit bombings. Speaking to reporters early Tuesday, Manchester’s chief constable, Ian Hopkins, said the police learned of the explosion around 10:33 p.m. Children were among those killed, he added, and the wounded were taken to eight hospitals. Chief Constable Hopkins said that a man had detonated “an improvised explosive device” and had been killed in the blast. He said the police believed that the man had acted alone, but that they were trying to determine whether he had been part of a wider network. Other officials said the police were investigating reports that the device had used nuts and bolts as shrapnel. The scene in central Manchester immediately evoked the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, which included a deadly assault inside the Bataclan concert hall, where the Eagles of Death Metal had been playing. But unlike the Bataclan show, the Manchester concert was filled with young teenagers. “This is currently being treated as a terrorist incident until the police know otherwise,” the Manchester police said in a Twitter post. Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the victims and their families in “what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack.” She was scheduled to lead a meeting of the government’s crisis response committee on Tuesday morning. At least one explosion went off in the foyer of the arena, according to the British Transport Police, the force that protects the Manchester Victoria train station next to the arena. The station was evacuated. Early Tuesday morning, Sky News reported that a bomb disposal team had arrived on the scene as part of the investigation and that the security cordon around the arena had been widened. Gary Walker, who was at the show with his wife and two daughters, said he “heard a massive bang and saw a flash” just as the concert concluded. He turned and realized that his wife had been hurt. Mr. Walker, who is from the northern city of Leeds, said she had a stomach wound and possibly a broken leg. He said he lay down on the floor beside her and saw “metal nuts on the floor.” Ms. Walker was taken to a hospital, Mr. Walker said while standing with his daughters in Deansgate, the main shopping street in Manchester. Another concertgoer, Sasina Akhtar, told The Manchester Evening News that there had been an explosion at the back of the arena after the last song. “We saw young girls with blood on them,” she said. “Everyone was screaming, and people were running.” Ms. Grande, a singer with a big voice who started her career as a star on a Nickelodeon TV series, is on an international tour supporting her 2016 album, “Dangerous Woman.” Two additional acts, Victoria Monét and Bia, performed as openers on Monday. The tour was scheduled to continue on Thursday at the O2 Arena in London. Ms. Grande was not hurt. TMZ, the entertainment news website, reported that she was “in hysterics” over the deadly blast. Her manager, Scooter Braun, said on Twitter, “We mourn the lives of children and loved ones taken by this cowardly act.” Parents separated from their children during the mayhem were told to go to a Holiday Inn, where many youngsters had taken refuge. A number of hotels, including the Holiday Inn and a Travelodge, opened their doors to concertgoers trapped inside the police cordon, providing them with drinks and phone chargers to enable them to contact family members. Residents also offered stranded concertgoers places to stay in their homes. The confusion and fear in the hours afterward were reflected on social media. One Twitter post asked: “Did anybody see my girlfriend? I lost her in the chaos.” SMG, the Pennsylvania-based company that manages the Manchester Arena, and Wes Westley, the company’s president and chief executive, described the precautions at the site. “It is obviously as tight security as anywhere in the States,” he said in an interview. “Backpacks are not allowed. Drinks are taken away from people. You have to go through very strict security to enter the arena.” The BBC interviewed a man who was waiting outside the arena to pick up his wife and daughter. He recounted that the “whole building shook,” that there was “carnage everywhere,” and that the explosion appeared to come from near the stadium’s ticket area. Videos posted on Twitter showed concertgoers running and screaming. Hannah Dane, who attended the performance, told The Guardian that she had heard “quite a loud explosion.” “It shook,” she said. “Then everyone screamed and tried to get out.” The Manchester Arena opened in 1995 and can hold up to 18,000 concertgoers; it was not clear how many people were in this crowd for the concert. Karen Ford told the BBC that she had been leaving the show when the blast occurred. “Everyone was just getting out of their seats and walking toward the stairs when all of a sudden a huge sound, which sounded like an explosion, went off,” she said. “Everyone tried to push people up the stairs,” Ms. Ford recalled, adding that in the chaos, people tried to push past a woman in a wheelchair as children screamed. She said there was no smoke, just one very loud bang. “It was very, very loud,” she said, adding that her husband thought he had heard a second explosion. “There were shoes on the floor” left behind by people who had fled, she recalled. “Just chaos,” she added. “I was trying to tell people to calm down.” She said the masses of people trying to flee created a perilous situation: “We were being crushed.” Outside, Ms. Ford said, parents awaited children who had attended the concert, checking their smartphones in a panic. “Everyone was trying to find each other,” she said. While the country and the world reacted to the news of the explosion and deaths with dismay, anger and grief, the British authorities, who have foiled numerous terrorist plots, were probably not surprised. The terrorist threat level set by MI5, the domestic intelligence service, has been at “severe,” the second-highest level, for months now, meaning officials considered an attack “highly likely.” While disenchanted young people can be radicalized through extremist websites, officials are particularly worried about the return of hundreds of battle-trained fighters who had left Britain or other European countries to join jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. Voters in Britain will go to the polls on June 8 in a general election, but the governing Conservatives — along with Labour, the Scottish National Party, and the Liberal Democrats — agreed to suspend campaigning because of the attack. With the election approaching, however, the Manchester assault seems bound to become part of the political discourse.","people, day, gun, shooting, know, tell, man, police, come, kill",world,europe
3229,Trump-Comey Feud Eclipses a Warning on Russia: ‘They Will Be Back’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — Lost in the showdown between President Trump and James B. Comey that played out this past week was a chilling threat to the United States. Mr. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., testified that the Russians had not only intervened in last year’s election, but would try to do it again. “It’s not a Republican thing or Democratic thing — it really is an American thing,” Mr. Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “They’re going to come for whatever party they choose to try and work on behalf of. And they’re not devoted to either, in my experience. They’re just about their own advantage. And they will be back.” What started out as a counterintelligence investigation to guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed into a political scandal about what Mr. Trump did, what he said and what he meant by it. Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the F.B.I. director he fired with cascading requests for documents, recordings and hearings. But from the headquarters of the National Security Agency to state capitals that have discovered that the Russians were inside their voter-registration systems, the worry is that attention will be diverted from figuring out how Russia disrupted American democracy last year and how to prevent it from happening again. Russian hackers did not just breach Democratic email accounts; according to Mr. Comey, they orchestrated a “massive effort” targeting hundreds of — and possibly more than 1,000 — American government and private organizations since 2015. “It’s important for us in the West to understand that we’re facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons to do us harm,” said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year. “Whatever the domestic politics of this, Comey was spot-on right that Russia is coming after us, but not just the U.S., but the free world in general. And we need to take this seriously.” Mr. Comey’s willingness to discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart. As F.B.I. director, he supervised counterintelligence investigations into computer break-ins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House, and that penetrated deep into the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yet President Barack Obama’s administration did not want to publicize those intrusions, choosing to handle them diplomatically — perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort to manipulate American politics. Mr. Comey’s special agents failed to react aggressively to evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee, spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young information-technology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organization’s emails. Only when emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operation. In October, Mr. Comey declined to sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election — not because he doubted the evidence, aides later said, the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem too political so close to Election Day. Now many members of Mr. Obama’s national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlier. And there is no evidence that the Russians have stopped. The N.S.A. suspects that a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has published tools used by the agency to breach foreign computer networks, is a front for Russia, probably the G.R.U., the military intelligence arm. The recent leak of a classified N.S.A. document, for which a contractor has been arrested, provided evidence that the G.R.U. was trying to penetrate a company that provides software used to check voter registrations at polling places, perhaps to wreak havoc. That data may be useful in future races. The Homeland Security Department is also looking at new evidence of computer code buried in the electrical power grid. Russia is believed to be behind two major attacks on Ukraine’s grid, and there are warnings that those techniques could also be turned on the United States. “This is part of what the Russians call ‘new generation warfare,’” Heather A. Conley, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an author of “The Kremlin Playbook,” said Thursday. “It’s a strategy of influence, not of brute force.” The strategy’s central concept, she said, refined in attacks on Eastern European countries, is that it is “better to collapse a country from within.” Eric S. Edelman, who was an under secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, said Russian information warfare capabilities were highly developed. “In the Cold War, the Soviet efforts in this regard were ham-handed and could be countered with relative ease,” he said. “Today, the Russians are much more sophisticated, and they see things like disinformation, propaganda and what we used to call ‘active measures’ as part of a suite of capabilities.” Graham Allison, a longtime Russia scholar at Harvard, said, “Russia’s cyberintrusion into the recent presidential election signals the beginning of what is almost sure to be an intensified cyberwar in which both they — and we — seek to participate in picking the leaders of an adversary.” The difference, he added, is that American elections are generally fair, so “we are much more vulnerable to such manipulation than is Russia,” where results are often preordained. In Washington, however, the issue has become partisan, because Mr. Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy. He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as “fake news” generated by Democrats to explain their defeat. He repeated that during a news conference on Friday. “That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn’t have lost,” he said. Mr. Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russia’s role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe. Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday, Mr. Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing to protect against future Russian intervention. “There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever,” Mr. Comey said. “The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that.” He added, “That’s about as un-fake as you can possibly get and is very, very serious.” Mr. Comey’s warning about the Russian threat was overshadowed by his confrontation with Mr. Trump, who fired him last month. “What we didn’t talk enough about was the purpose we were there, about Russia’s involvement and Russia’s intent, how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue to keep trying and hitting on us to change how we do business in America, how we elect our officials, the confidence we have in our government,” Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said Friday on “Morning Joe” on MSNBC. Similar warnings have been issued by others in the intelligence community, led by James R. Clapper Jr., who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as director of national intelligence. “I don’t think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing,” he said recently. But few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams — they started a scandal that has consumed the American political process. “They can win two ways,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday. “They can do it” trying to influence votes, “or they can get caught doing it,” and undercut confidence in the American electoral system.","year, time, like, new, think, way, come, long, change, want",us,politics
8341,"Children, Caged for Effect, to Mimic Imagery of ISIS - The New York Times","BEIRUT, Lebanon — The killings have been both deliberately lurid and strangely intimate. Designed for broadcast, they have helped the Islamic State militant group build a brand of violence that shocks with its extreme brutality, yet feels as close to viewers as the family images on their smartphones. Broadcast specifically to frighten and manipulate, the Islamic State’s flamboyant violence consumes the world’s attention while more familiar threats, like the Syrian government’s barrel bombs, kill far more but rarely provoke global outrage. A few human rights advocates and antigovernment activists in Syria are creating shocking if nonviolent images and videos — even herding children in orange jumpsuits into a cage — to call attention to the wider scope of violence. So far, though, their voices have hardly been heard. The Islamic State’s campaign of high-profile killings is not war at a remove, with the mechanized distance of drone strikes or carpet bombing. It is one-on-one slaughter with Hollywood production values, seeking to maximize emotional impact and propaganda value. Cameras zoom in as captors lay hands on their captives — Western reporters, a Jordanian pilot, Egyptian Christian laborers. In the group’s latest video, black-clad men lead the Egyptians almost gently, one by one, down a sunset-tinged beach, then saw off their heads until the waves turn red. For many in the Middle East who obsessively share the latest images, the Islamic State’s exhibitionist brutality is the apotheosis of several years of carnage gone viral. The group’s bloody imagery, flooding social media already widely used to chronicle conflict, makes violence seem ubiquitous, even mesmerizing, and spurs a sensory overload that can both provoke feelings and numb them. “It’s like action movies,” said Ahmad, 39, an employee of the Damascus Opera House in the Syrian capital, who asked to be identified by only his first name for his safety. Islamic State violence is stylized, as if in a Quentin Tarantino film, he said, in a macabre bid “to win the prestige of horror.” The killings have been answered quickly with airstrikes — from the United States, Jordan and, on Monday, from Egypt, which said it struck in Libya, where the Egyptian Copts were killed. While the Islamic State’s provocations draw pronounced reactions, however, the less-choreographed slaughter that has killed, for instance, more than 200,000 Syrians fades to the background. Those bearing the brunt of the Syrian war’s spillover across the region, and humanitarian workers trying to assist, frequently express anguish that government bombings, the displacement of more than a third of the population and the gutting of the health care system do not bring similar attention — let alone dramatic action. Of course, that is partly a matter of realpolitik. While Western governments denounce Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, for attacks on civilians, they do not view him as a threat on the order of the Islamic State, which is encouraging followers to launch attacks in the West. And that difference in Western perception of the two threats exists partly because shock videos work. Even in Saudi Arabia, where beheadings are the state’s method of capital punishment, they are not broadcast. When images of a recent execution leaked, they created a scandal. But the perception gap is also because the shelling of cities in Syria has become almost numbingly normal. It is as if the value of trauma and shock has undergone a hyperinflation that neuters all but the most exaggerated images of violence. That, in turn, has pushed human rights advocates and activists to search for eye-grabbing images of their own. Baraa Abdulrahman, an antigovernment activist in the Damascus suburb of Douma, desperate to direct the world’s attention to government airstrikes that were killing scores of people, set up a scene that echoed the Islamic State video in which the caged Jordanian pilot, in an orange jumpsuit, was burned alive. He ordered an iron cage from a blacksmith and placed it against a backdrop of collapsed buildings, and then filled it with a gaggle of neighborhood children dressed in orange. As the camera rolled, he waved a burning torch, asking why the world responded to the killing of the pilot but not to the deaths of children in Douma. Some of the children in the cage, he admitted, were frightened and cried. “I’m very sorry to get to this point, to use the kids,” said Mr. Abdulrahman, who uses a nom de guerre for security. “But this is the fact. Our kids are getting killed every day, every moment, getting under the wreckage.” Yet images of mangled children no longer get traction, he said. “These sights, people now are used to them.” Antigovernment activists are not alone in trying to compete with the war’s most lurid imagery. The Syrian government has made much of a video of an insurgent ripping the organs from a slain soldier and taking a bite.  Humanitarian organizations are also seeing the power of startling videos. A group training volunteer civil defense workers has circulated a video of what it calls “the miracle baby,” an infant named Mohammad who is seen being pulled from the rubble of an airstrike. Opposition groups have passed around videos from the captured cellphones of pro-government fighters and soldiers who have apparently filmed their own cruelty, like one of a militiaman stabbing an old man in the head. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees widely circulated images of triplets born in a snowstorm in a refugee camp, only to lose their mother to complications from childbirth. “There is personal tragedy of mammoth proportions happening every day by the thousands in individual lives that never get picked up by a media camera,” said Ninette Kelley, the director of the refugee agency in Lebanon, where more than one million Syrians have fled. “Refugees whose lives have been irrevocably damaged, people who die from cancers that but for the crisis would have been treated in Syria, these wounds are very real but not always as visible.” A few have even been tempted to fictionalize. Last year, for instance, a viral video of a Syrian boy saving a girl from sniper fire turned out to have been staged by a Norwegian film crew. But while some groups want to publicize suffering in order to stop it, analysts said perpetrators like the Islamic State seek to magnify the suffering by inflicting it twice — first on the victim and then on the viewer. “One of the things about traumatic imagery is that it can numb us and render us passive and helpless,” said Gavin Rees, the Europe director for the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, which focuses on the issues of reporting on violence. “That is part of the gain for those who are producing these videos: They want to inspire fear and helplessness.”","State, Islamic, Syria, attack, military, official, group, force, Iraq, terrorist",world,middleeast
2019,Cheesecake for the Soul: A ‘Golden Girls’ Cafe Opens - The New York Times,"Picture it: Manhattan, 2017. A crisp Saturday morning. Every table in Rue La Rue Cafe — a new restaurant in Washington Heights dedicated to Rue McClanahan and her hit television series, “The Golden Girls” — was occupied, including one in a replica of the kitchen set from the show. The pumps Ms. McClanahan (Blanche) wore in the pilot episode are displayed in a glass case. Mannequins draped in her gowns surrounded a pianist and guitarist playing mellow jazz on a corner stage. Behind them, on a pedestal, was her 1987 Emmy for lead actress. When the musicians took a break, a mounted television was turned up so customers could watch episodes that play steadily. Conversation happily quieted as Bea Arthur (Dorothy) and Hal Linden were heard saying good night after a sixth-season date. “This is a museum!” said a woman in line to order. From behind the counter, the co-owner, Michael J. LaRue, replied, “It’s a museum with good food.” Few series radiate the necessary warmth to justify a tribute restaurant, but “The Golden Girls,” that enduring electric blanket of American television, is a part of the culture that people have held tight. It has been 25 years since the end of the sitcom about four older Miami housemates — Dorothy, the salty wit; Rose (Betty White), the lovable dim bulb; Sophia (Estelle Getty), the Italian spitfire; and Blanche, the Southern vixen — but fans keep finding new ways to love it, with countless parodies, action figures and T-shirts, and Hulu’s recent nabbing of exclusive streaming rights. For all the show’s zany plots, what fans seem to cherish most are the intimate scenes in which the four friends sit around their kitchen table, sharing a cheesecake and talking into the night. That spirit has now become a guiding force for Mr. LaRue, 53, who owns the restaurant with Ms. McClanahan’s son, Mark Bish. Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue. When Ms. McClanahan died in 2010, he became the executor of her estate, which includes an extensive personal archive that Ms. McClanahan wanted made available to her fans. “A little voice in my head said, ‘Restaurant!’” Mr. LaRue said during a recent interview. A 16-year resident of Washington Heights, he had no other neighborhood in mind for the new spot. “Before, we’d have to go downtown for good food and live entertainment,” he said. “I want people to stay in the neighborhood, and if they don’t live here, to come uptown.” Construction on the space, formerly a pet store, lasted nearly a year. The bathroom was outfitted to match the show’s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was hand-cut to match its exact look in Blanche’s bedroom. CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers. The menu, from Michele Weber, formerly the chef at Good Enough to Eat, will feature nods to the show — lasagna al forno, Genügenflürgen cake — and recipes shared by the cast: Ms. Arthur’s chutney, Ms. White’s angel food cake, Ms. Getty’s pasta salad. There are also signature coffee blends: Sophia’s “Picture It” Sicilian Roast (inspired by a favorite line of the character), Rose’s St. Olaf blend, Dorothy’s No-Nonsense Roast, and, for a little spice, Blanche’s Gentlemen Caller’s Beans. “My grandma loved the show,” said Patrick Rickerfor, 41, who was making his fourth visit to Rue La Rue. “She was from Honduras and didn’t understand English all that well, but she got the slapstick comedy.” Ana Perez, 28, was back for the second day in a row. “I’m a Blanche,” she admitted proudly. Anabel Perez, 23, her sister, said, “I’m a Dorothy.” “And we’ve got a little Sophia over there,” Ana added, gesturing to their young cousin, buried in a game on her smartphone. “It was my favorite show growing up. That episode where Mario Lopez got deported makes me cry.” Junko (a Sophia) and Paul Lindberg (a Rose) were grocery-shopping when they noticed that the cafe had opened. They threw their bags down at home and raced over. “We used to walk by here every day, thinking, ‘When’s it going to open?’” Ms. Lindberg said. “My mom in Japan keeps asking me, ‘Is that cafe open yet?’” Bix Gabriel, from Bloomington, Ind., and her sister Marisa Gabriel, from Adelaide, Australia, overheard talk of the place in an Ethiopian restaurant a few nights earlier and frantically Googled. “We sang the theme song coming in,” Bix Gabriel said. “The show was so progressive and ahead of its time,” Joe Samalian, Ms. Gabriel’s husband, added. “It passes the Bechdel test like you wouldn’t believe.” “I must say,” Marisa Gabriel said, leaning in, “‘The Golden Girls’ is the best cure for postpartum depression. I have two children, and I watched it each time, and it helped me immensely.” Mr. LaRue echoed a similar sentiment: “I know people who put on ‘Golden Girls’ DVDs the way others take a Valium.” One of the walls features photographs of Ms. McClanahan’s six husbands, while another is dedicated to Ms. White, the last surviving Girl, who hopes to get to Rue La Rue in the spring. Near the end of Ms. McClanahan’s life, Ms. White sent her a fresh orchid every week, as well as pears and oranges from California. “She would call and say, ‘Can I talk to Ruesy?’” Mr. LaRue recalled. “One day, right before the stroke, do you know what they were talking about? Ryan Reynolds. Betty was in that movie ‘The Proposal,’ and Rue’s in the hospital, like, ‘Who’s that young man? He’s delicious.’ She was boy-crazy up until the last minute of her life.” Mr. LaRue is full of these stories, and happy to share them. “She sewed for me, she baked for me,” he said. “My mother died when I was 8 years old. I had this hole in my being that I didn’t even realize.” A sidewalk plaque at the entrance bears Ms. McClanahan’s name and the opening lyrics of the show’s theme song, “Thank You for Being a Friend.” Some of her ashes are buried underneath. “There’s never a time when ‘The Golden Girls’ is not playing on this globe,” Mr. LaRue said. “It taps into something that we all share as human beings — a fear that as we age we’re going to become irrelevant and alone. The show is a tonic for that fear. It says you can still look good and have sex and have a very full life, with friends.” “I once asked Rue why she got married so often, and she said, ‘I don’t want to die alone,’” he recalled. “And she didn’t; I was there, holding her. I was able to look in her eyes and tell her, ‘Everything’s going to be O.K., you have nothing to worry about.’” He smiled, suddenly teary. “I still miss her.” Looking around the cafe, he added, “But she would love this.” On the television, Ms. McClanahan, Ms. Arthur and Ms. White sang “Mr. Sandman” to lull a baby to sleep. Patrons, seeking shelter from the cold, happily watched. The baby quieted, and the Girls tried to tiptoe off. He cried, and they started up again. They sang until he slept.","people, day, gun, shooting, know, tell, man, police, come, kill",arts,television
2095,He’s a Local Pillar in a Trump Town. Now He Could Be Deported. - The New York Times,"WEST FRANKFORT, Ill. — Ask residents of this coal-mining crossroads about President Trump’s decision to crack down on undocumented immigrants and most offer no protest. Mr. Trump, who easily won this mostly white southern Illinois county, is doing what he promised, they say. As Terry Chambers, a barber on Main Street, put it, the president simply wants “to get rid of the bad eggs.” But then they took Carlos. Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco — just Carlos to the people of West Frankfort — has been the manager of La Fiesta, a Mexican restaurant in this city of 8,000, for a decade. Yes, he always greeted people warmly at the cheerfully decorated restaurant, known for its beef and chicken fajitas. And, yes, he knew their children by name. But people here tick off more things they know Carlos for. How one night last fall, when the Fire Department was battling a two-alarm blaze, Mr. Hernandez suddenly appeared with meals for the firefighters. How he hosted a Law Enforcement Appreciation Day at the restaurant last summer as police officers were facing criticism around the country. How he took part in just about every community committee or charity effort — the Rotary Club, cancer fund-raisers, cleanup days, even scholarships for the Redbirds, the high school sports teams, which are the pride of this city. “I think people need to do things the right way, follow the rules and obey the laws, and I firmly believe in that,” said Lori Barron, the owner of Lori’s Hair A’Fairs, a beauty salon. “But in the case of Carlos, I think he may have done more for the people here than this place has ever given him. I think it’s absolutely terrible that he could be taken away.” On Feb. 9, Mr. Hernandez, 38, was arrested by federal immigration agents near his home, not far from La Fiesta, and taken to a detention facility in Missouri. The federal authorities confirmed that he remained in custody, but would not comment on the precise reason for or timing of his arrest. Immigration officials noted that Mr. Hernandez had two drunken-driving convictions from 2007, a circumstance that could make him a higher priority for deportation. Friends of his say he crossed into the United States from Mexico in the late 1990s and had started but never completed efforts to legalize his status. As Victor Arana, a lawyer for Mr. Hernandez, began pressing in court to seek release for Mr. Hernandez on bond until his case can be heard, the community has rallied around him, writing pleas for leniency to the officials who will decide his fate. Tom Jordan, the mayor of West Frankfort, wrote that Mr. Hernandez was a “great asset” to the city who “doesn’t ask for anything in return.” The fire chief described him as “a man of great character.” The letters have piled up — from the county prosecutor, the former postmaster, the car dealer, the Rotary Club president. In his note, Richard Glodich, the athletic director at Frankfort Community High School, wrote, “As a grandson of immigrants, I am all for immigration reform, but this time you have arrested a GOOD MAN that should be used as a role model for other immigrants.” This is an uncomfortable stance for a place like West Frankfort. This county, Franklin, backed Mr. Trump with 70 percent of the vote, largely on hopes, people here say, that he could jump-start the coal industry, which has receded painfully here over decades. Illegal immigration was by no means the most pressing issue for this overwhelmingly white area, residents say. Still, many say they concur in principle with Mr. Trump’s wish to be more aggressive in blocking those who seek to sneak across the border. Things grew more tangled when principle met West Frankfort’s particular reality, in the form of Carlos. Many people said they had no idea Mr. Hernandez lacked legal status until word of his arrest began spreading. “I knew he was Mexican, but he’s been here so long, he’s just one of us,” said Debra Johnson, a resident. She said she saw a distinction between “people who come over and use the system and people who actually come and help.” Not everyone feels Mr. Hernandez should be treated unlike anyone else without permission to be here. As friends have gathered words of support for him through an email address — istandwithcarlos@gmail.com — other messages have arrived there, too. “Carlos is probably a nice man, but he broke our country’s law,” one email read. Some critics point to the two drunken-driving cases. (His friends say he quit drinking after that.) Asked about Mr. Hernandez, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a statement that read, in part: “Every day, as part of routine operations, ICE officers target and arrest criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation’s immigration laws.” After a report of his detention appeared in a local newspaper, The Southern Illinoisan, some comments were pointed: “No U.S. citizen is above the U.S. law! If a U.S. citizen breaks a law they go to jail or prison! No illegal alien is above the U.S. law!” And: “I get that this man has been here for years and years and has contributed to society, but he isn’t LEGAL, therefore the U.S. has every right to throw him out.” And: “A couple thousand down, millions to go.” Around West Frankfort, some people grow quiet when asked whether some undocumented people should be granted exceptions. “With everything that’s gone on — we’ve had years of unemployment rates that are skyrocketing — I would like to see some of the people that I know go back to work before I worry about people from other countries coming here and making a better life for themselves,” said Audrey Loftus, 38, a bartender at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars post. But Mr. Hernandez, Ms. Loftus said, has left her “on the fence” about what should happen now. “I hate to use the word rednecks, but this is southern Illinois,” she said. “This is the definition of a good old boys’ club, and you don’t have a lot of people of different ethnicities that are in this area. “And then there’s Carlos,” she continued. “You will not find a single person that has anything bad to say about him.” Mr. Hernandez’s lawyer said that a hearing was expected in his case on Wednesday and that he was hoping Mr. Hernandez might be released on bond as any legal action went forward. His wife, Elizabeth Hernandez, who attained United States citizenship late last year, according to Mr. Arana, said she was struggling to sleep, since her husband was detained. The couple has three sons, the youngest 2. “What I’m really worrying about,” she said in a telephone interview, “is what am I going to tell my three boys if he can’t stay here?” Tim Grigsby, who owns a local printing shop and considers Mr. Hernandez one of his closest friends, has been helping to lead the efforts to bring Mr. Hernandez back to West Frankfort. He said he had always known that Mr. Hernandez did a lot around town. But he said that even he did not grasp the scope of it all until the letters started flowing in. There was the pastor who described Mr. Hernandez helping at a funeral, the family that remembered him raising hundreds of dollars for its son’s hearing aid, the businessman who said that he was mostly a private person but that Mr. Hernandez was one of the few people he invites over for dinner. Mr. Grigsby said he still would vote for Mr. Trump. One never agrees with everything a politician does, “but maybe this should all be more on a per-case basis,” he said. “It’s hard to be black and white on this because there may be people like Carlos.”","year, work, people, worker, job, child, live, percent, like, number",us,
3114,How Much Trump Is Good for the G.O.P. in House Races? - The New York Times,"ROSWELL, Ga. — In the northern suburbs of Atlanta, where what is likely to be the most expensive House campaign in history is being waged, a band of conservative advocacy groups is grappling with a question that may decide whether the Republican Party keeps its House majority after 2018: Do you run with President Trump or against him? Somehow, the groups are discovering, they will have to do both. The race between the Republican Karen Handel and the Democrat Jon Ossoff in this reliably Republican district has become a proving ground for the surrogates tasked with defending the party’s majority. Both sides together could spend more than $40 million on the race to fill a seat that had been held by Tom Price, now the secretary of health and human services. So far, Republicans have chalked up single-digit victories in Montana and Kansas special elections to replace other House Republicans tapped by Mr. Trump for his cabinet. Democrats made gains in both races from their 2016 showings. But for Republicans, a win is a win. Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, however, is different: an affluent, educated cluster of suburbs that barely went for Mr. Trump in November and could foretell the hazards in other suburban battleground contests in 2018. Some of the biggest players on the right are involved. The Koch network, the National Rifle Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and various socially conservative and faith-based organizations are using the campaign as a dry run for untangling the conservative crosscurrents they will have to manage with Mr. Trump as the party’s leader. Ms. Handel is struggling with the same knot. She welcomed the president for a fund-raiser last month, but kept it closed to the public. She batted away reports that Mr. Trump had shared highly classified information with the Russians by saying they could just be a “gross assumption” by the media, a view many in the district share. But she added that she supported an investigation to resolve the matter. And when the White House sends in reinforcements to campaign with Ms. Handel ahead of Election Day on June 20, Vice President Mike Pence will be the headliner, not Mr. Trump. The trick for Republicans and their allied outside groups is figuring out how to avoid conspicuously embracing the president without alienating conservative voters who would view any overt rebuff as a betrayal. “That is the question we are trying to answer right now,” said Ralph Reed, whose Faith and Freedom Coalition is based in Georgia and is involved in the special election. As for Mr. Trump, Mr. Reed added: “I don’t think you really look to broadcast him. You narrowcast him.” The Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “narrowcast” comes in the form of about 30,000 one-page leaflets that volunteers will slip into church bulletins across the district ahead of the election. They list a series of issues that are resonant with conservatives and at the top of Mr. Trump’s agenda — like Planned Parenthood funding, “abortion on demand,” freedom of speech for churches and “amnesty for illegal immigrants” — and offer a side-by-side comparison of Ms. Handel’s and Mr. Ossoff’s stands. The coalition has identified more than 100,000 potential voters it will target in 250,000 phone calls, 22,000 home visits and 12 videos that will be sent to their phones and computers. At the other end of the spectrum are groups like the Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity and the Congressional Leadership Fund, which are determined to keep their distance from Mr. Trump. The Congressional Leadership Fund plans to have at least 20 offices up and running by the end of the year in districts across the country, including one in Roswell that will stay open after the June election. Those offices will be primarily in districts that are a lot like Georgia’s Sixth: suburban centers populated with highly educated, well-off voters who are not terribly enthusiastic about Mr. Trump. Those districts, in places like California, New Jersey and Florida, will be the terrain on which the Republican House majority is won or lost. Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, embodies the contradictions and competing interests that will make races like hers so hard for Republicans. As a more conventional chamber of commerce-type Republican, she appeals to the party’s traditional constituency. But she is also struggling to excite the voters who rejected that type of Republicanism when they voted for Mr. Trump last year. “I’m a little nervous,” admitted John Rogers, a real estate broker who answered the door of his home in Roswell recently when a high school volunteer for the Congressional Leadership Fund paid a visit. Mr. Rogers, who describes himself as a conservative but not a Republican, is dismayed by Mr. Trump’s first few months in office. “The things that come out of his mouth just blow my mind,” he said. He worried that Democrats were drawing a lot of motivation from the president’s scandals, energy that he said he did not see on the Republican side. “The Democrats at this point are so riled up. And they have a lot to prove,” he said. The message that groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Congressional Leadership Fund are pushing in Georgia is Trump-agnostic. The goal is to remind conservative-leaning voters of the common enemy they have in Washington Democrats, even if the headlines about Mr. Trump are too ubiquitous to avoid. This has meant portraying Mr. Ossoff, a 30-year-old filmmaker who had never run for office before and lives outside the district, as a pawn of Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and someone who has been bought and paid for by donors in San Francisco and New York. “He’s supported by foreigners,” said Julia Bridges, a retired college secretary who used air quotes to indicate that she did not mean actual foreigners but “people from California and places like that.” As she took a break from calling voters from the Faith and Freedom Coalition offices, she added disapprovingly, “We don’t much care for that.” A new commercial from the Congressional Leadership Fund, which plans to spend $7 million on the race and knock on the doors of 300,000 homes before the election, depicts people on the streets of San Francisco snidely thanking Georgians for Mr. Ossoff. “We already have Nancy Pelosi as our congresswoman,” says one actor in Willie Nelson-style braids as he flashes a peace symbol to the camera. “Now you’re going to give us Jon Ossoff as our congressman.” But the president does not exactly possess the retiring persona that could make diverting the focus away from him easier. “This race is a lot closer than it should be, and that’s for one reason: Donald Trump,” said Whit Ayres, a pollster who is advising Republicans on the Georgia race. If the debate is primarily about the president, Republicans cannot easily shift the focus toward more parochial matters — like money for public works, local military bases and schools — that would usually allow them a measure of political isolation. “What’s driving this race,” Mr. Ayres added, “are broader national factors that are not in anyone’s control.” The national implications seem clear to many voters, who understand the vulnerability that a Republican loss would telegraph to the country. Bob Harris, a retired sixth-grade science teacher who lives in once reliably Republican east Cobb County, said he was not exactly “on fire when it comes to Karen Handel.” He wishes Mr. Trump would get off Twitter and take a lesson in composure from more coolheaded advisers like Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. But he wants a Republican to win the seat so badly that he is volunteering for Americans for Prosperity, the group funded by the billionaire conservatives Charles G. and David H. Koch, and was making phone calls to voters from its office in Marietta on a recent rainy evening. “I wouldn’t bet any money on this one,” he said, acknowledging how close the race seemed. “The Democrats smell blood in the water.”","year, time, like, new, think, way, come, long, change, want",us,politics
3512,Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign - The New York Times,"The Times now has the email to Donald Trump Jr. offering Russian aid to “incriminate Hillary.” His reply: “If it’s what you say I love it.” Read the new article. WASHINGTON — Before arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father’s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email. The email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a Kremlin proxy. Mr. Goldstone’s message, as described to The New York Times by the three people, indicates that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. It does not elaborate on the wider effort by Moscow to help the Trump campaign. There is no evidence to suggest that the promised damaging information was related to Russian government computer hacking that led to the release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails. The meeting took place less than a week before it was widely reported that Russian hackers had infiltrated the committee’s servers. But the email is likely to be of keen interest to the Justice Department and congressional investigators, who are examining whether any of President Trump’s associates colluded with the Russian government to disrupt last year’s election. American intelligence agencies have determined that the Russian government tried to sway the election in favor of Mr. Trump. The Times first reported on the existence of the meeting on Saturday, and a fuller picture has emerged in subsequent days. Alan Futerfas, the lawyer for the younger Mr. Trump, said his client had done nothing wrong but pledged to work with investigators if contacted. “In my view, this is much ado about nothing. During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia,” he told The Times in an email on Monday. “Don Jr.’s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.” It is unclear whether Mr. Goldstone had direct knowledge of the origin of the damaging material. One person who was briefed on the emails said it appeared that he was passing along information that had been passed through several others. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, the campaign chairman at the time, also attended the June 2016 meeting in New York. Representatives for Mr. Kushner referred requests for comments back to an earlier statement, which said he had voluntarily disclosed the meeting to the federal government. He has deferred questions on the content of the meeting to Donald Trump Jr. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment. But at the White House, the deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was adamant from the briefing room lectern that “the president’s campaign did not collude in any way. Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election. No one within the Trump campaign colluded in order to influence the election.” The president, a prolific Twitter user, did not address his son’s controversy on Monday, and instead sought to highlight other issues throughout the morning. In a series of tweets, the president’s son insisted he had done what anyone connected to a political campaign would have done — hear out potentially damaging information about an opponent. He maintained that his various statements about the meeting were not in conflict. “Obviously I’m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,” he wrote in one tweet. In another, he added, “No inconsistency in statements, meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions. In response to further Q’s I simply provided more details.” The younger Mr. Trump, who had a reputation during the campaign for having meetings with a wide range of people eager to speak to him, did not join his father’s administration. He runs the family business, the Trump Organization, with his brother Eric. On Monday, after news reports that he had hired a lawyer, he indicated in a tweet that he would be open to speaking to the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating Russian meddling in the election. “Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,” the younger Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Goldstone represents the Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, whose father was President Trump’s business partner in bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. In an interview Monday, Mr. Goldstone said he was asked by Mr. Agalarov to set up the meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. “He said, ‘I’m told she has information about illegal campaign contributions to the D.N.C.,’” Mr. Goldstone recalled, referring to the Democratic National Committee. He said he then emailed Donald Trump Jr., outlining what the lawyer purported to have. But Mr. Goldstone, who wrote the email over a year ago, denied any knowledge of involvement by the Russian government in the matter, saying that never dawned on him. “Never, never ever,” he said. Later, after the email was described to The Times, efforts to reach him for further comment were unsuccessful. In the interview, he said it was his understanding that Ms. Veselnitskaya was simply a “private citizen” for whom Mr. Agalarov wanted to do a favor. He also said he did not know whether Mr. Agalarov’s father, Aras Agalarov, a Moscow real estate tycoon known to be close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was involved. The elder Mr. Agalarov and the younger Mr. Trump worked together to bring a Trump Tower to Moscow, but the project never got off the ground. Mr. Goldstone also said his recollection of the meeting largely tracked with the account given by the president’s son, as outlined in the Sunday statement Mr. Trump issued in response to a Times article on the June 2016 meeting. Mr. Goldstone said the last time he had communicated with the younger Mr. Trump was to send him a congratulatory text after the November election, but he added that he did speak to the Trump Organization over the past weekend, before giving his account to the news media. Donald Trump Jr., who initially told The Times that Ms. Veselnitskaya wanted to talk about the resumption of adoption of Russian children by American families, acknowledged in the Sunday statement that one subject of the meeting was possibly compromising information about Mrs. Clinton. His decision to move ahead with such a meeting was unusual for a political campaign, but it was consistent with the haphazard approach the Trump operation, and the White House, have taken in vetting people they deal with ahead of time. But he said that the Russian lawyer produced nothing of consequence, and that the meeting ended after she began talking about the Magnitsky Act — an American law that blacklists Russians suspected of human rights abuses. The 2012 law so enraged Mr. Putin that he halted American adoptions of Russian children. Mr. Goldstone said Ms. Veselnitskaya offered “just a vague, generic statement about the campaign’s funding and how people, including Russian people, living all over the world donate when they shouldn’t donate” before turning to her anti-Magnitsky Act arguments. “It was the most inane nonsense I’ve ever heard,” he said. “And I was actually feeling agitated by it. Had I, you know, actually taken up what is a huge amount of their busy time with this nonsense?” Ms. Veselnitskaya, for her part, denied that the campaign or compromising material about Mrs. Clinton ever came up. She said she had never acted on behalf of the Russian government. A representative for Mr. Putin said on Monday that he did not know Ms. Veselnitskaya, and that he had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting. Ms. Sanders said at a news briefing that the American president had learned of the meeting recently, but she declined to discuss details. The White House press office, however, accused Mrs. Clinton’s team of hypocrisy. The office circulated a January 2017 article published in Politico, detailing how officials from the Ukrainian government tried to help the Democratic candidate conduct opposition research on Mr. Trump and some of his aides. News of the meeting involving the younger Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort blunted whatever good feeling the president’s team had after his trip to Europe for the Group of 20 economic summit meeting. The president learned from his aides about the 2016 meeting at the end of the trip, according to a White House official. But some people in the White House had known for several days that it had occurred, because Mr. Kushner had revised his foreign contact disclosure document to include it. The president was frustrated by the news of the meeting, according to a person close to him — less over the fact that it had happened, and more because it was yet another story about Russia that had swamped the news cycle.","Trump, Obama, president, Bush, White, House, President, campaign, adviser, Carson",us,politics
9811,Bernie Sanders Draws Big Crowds to His ‘Political Revolution’ - The New York Times,"DUBUQUE, Iowa — As 1,800 mad-as-hell supporters jumped out of their seats and pumped their fists last Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont delivered the message they had come to hear. We will “give these guys an offer they can’t refuse,” he shouted in the jam-packed gym, vowing to bust up the banks, bring down the billionaire class and smash the political establishment. “So I welcome you all,” he said, “to the political revolution of 2015.” The presidential election is, of course, in 2016, but Mr. Sanders can be forgiven for living in the moment. By overtaking Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire in some polls and drawing tens of thousands of people to his events on the West Coast, as well as thousands in Iowa and Nevada, Mr. Sanders, 73, has recaptured the enthusiasm that fueled the 2008 Obama campaign, with T-shirts that say “Feel the Bern” and show an image of floppy white hair and glasses replacing the famous image in the Obama “Hope” poster by Shepard Fairey. Unlike that of Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders’s appeal is less about oratorical lift and finding common ground than about the opportunity his campaign gives disaffected Democrats to vent their anger at the list of national ills they believe are caused by big business and its conservative allies and have been left unaddressed by President Obama. If Mrs. Clinton’s pitch to voters is that she can make the system more effective, Mr. Sanders is arguing that Mr. Obama was naïve to even bother with a system that needs to be fundamentally changed. It is not a new message for Mr. Sanders, who came up in radical left politics, but the response is something unfamiliar. For someone who has always had a sweepingly macro, if not entirely Marxist, critique of America, having the largest crowds of the election cheering each description of income inequality, and each proposal to eradicate it, amounts to the validation of a career spent in relative obscurity. Mr. Sanders’s grumpy demeanor, his outsider status and his suspicion of all things “feel good,” are part of the attraction. “He’s feeling the weight of ‘Wow, people really need this,’ ” Jane Sanders said after one of the seven appearances her husband made last weekend in Iowa. She said Mr. Sanders was “humbled” by the success, remained as focused on the issues as ever, and “doesn’t believe in the cult of personality.” Yet when asked why Mr. Sanders was attracting so many people, she added: “Because if not now, when? And if not him, who?” Anybody else appears to be the answer of the Democratic establishment. Yet while the candidate’s own staff sees the immense challenges before them with a professional eye, Mr. Sanders admits to no doubts. And he treats any trespassers to his circle of believers accordingly. When a gaggle of reporters — “corporate media” in Sanders parlance — mentioned Mrs. Clinton here, he snarled, “That’s the sport you guys like,” meaning their focus on the kind of political questions he disdains. When asked to reconcile his anti-establishment status with being a “career politician,” Mr. Sanders, who except for two years has held political office continually since 1981, glared at the young reporter who asked the question. “Career politician?” he said to her with a disdainful laugh. “Other questions.” Mr. Sanders is clearly a different sort of political animal. If the tradition is to campaign in poetry and govern in prose, Mr. Sanders does both with a long list of bullet points written on a yellow legal pad he looks at when he speaks. “We’re going to practice democracy. How’s that?” he exclaimed to huge applause at the start of the Dubuque event, before launching into an hourlong speech that left no time for questions. In front of crowds, Mr. Sanders dispenses with his biography as quickly as possible, introducing his wife, who waves back or shoots video on her iPhone, and mentioning that he has kids and grandkids and a father who immigrated to America from Poland with nothing. He seems to go through the motions of reaching for the emotional connection that other candidates try to seize, referring to the joy of childbirth as “extraordinary, unbelievable, O.K.,” before quickly shifting to the dearth of family leave time for working women. But the people don’t come to hear Mr. Sanders’s story. They come for his analysis of what’s gone wrong. Americans, Mr. Sanders says, live under an oligarchy of billionaires, the Koch brothers and Walmart owners and Wall Street chieftains who conspire to keep the workingman down. Their information is dumbed down by a news media that avoids the issues, treats campaigns like soap operas and begs him to “beat up on Hillary Clinton.” In Iowa, where he is inching up in polls, the crowds nodded passionately as he cited the real unemployment level and bemoaned institutional racism and the “starvation wages” hobbling American workers already handicapped by international trade deals. There were also mentions of Republican attempts at voter suppression, which “profoundly disgusts me,” the increased oceanic acidity and rising temperatures that threatened the globe, as well as the pharmaceutical companies and enemies of Social Security who prey on the sick and elderly. “What’s wrong with that picture?” he asked at another Iowa appearance, and then proceeded to describe what life would be like “under a Sanders administration.” He would invest in enormous infrastructure projects that he said would create more than 10 million jobs. He would expand, not shrink, Social Security, and move the United States to a single payer health care system. Legislation that he intends to propose or already has would automatically register anyone older than 18 to vote, kick private corporations out of the prison business, make public college tuition free, guarantee sick and paid family leave and a “couple of weeks paid vacation” to workers. He would break up the banks that are too big to fail, keep us out of any more wars and pay for much of his spending program with a tax on Wall Street trading. “The middle class and working class bailed you out,” he bellowed. “Now it’s your turn.” As for the critique that none of these proposals is remotely plausible given the political realities in Washington, the Sanders campaign argues that the “nightmare scenario” of a Democratic president with a Republican Congress would never happen. “It is an unlikely outcome to have Bernie Sanders elected president and to keep the Congress in its current composition,” said Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager, explaining a sort of fantasy scenario. Or, as Mr. Sanders put it at a labor meeting in Clinton, Iowa: Without a revolution, “Forget about it, nothing’s going to happen.” And that, he says, was the problem with Mr. Obama. While Mr. Sanders offered “congratulations” to Iowa for having the courage to vote for an African-American in 2008, he said “one of his mistakes” that Mr. Obama made after winning with a movement behind him was then saying, “I’ll take it from here.” “What Obama should have known and what I know,” Mr. Sanders said, is that wealthy vested interests were too powerful for any one person to take on. It was around then that Fred Bowes, a 77-year-old Democrat, walked out of an event in Boone. “Everything he said is true,” Mr. Bowes said. “Implementing what he says is next to impossible.” That is a dissenting view among the crowds at Mr. Sanders’s rallies and events, where he welcomes gushing comparisons to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie,” the crowd of Sanders supporters chanted as the senator approached the entrance of Iowa State Fair. As Mr. Sanders made his way toward the fair’s famous Soapbox Stage, Mitchell Wear, who had come from Columbus to hear Mr. Sanders speak, was able to shake his hand. “Oh my God, that was awesome,” Mr. Wear said as the entourage made its way past pork chop, caprese-on-a-stick and fried cheese curd stands. Back in Burlington after the weekend, Mr. Sanders called his close friend Richard Sugarman, a University of Vermont professor of Jewish philosophy and self-described “biblical socialist.” Mr. Sugarman said he grilled the candidate on whether he had eaten a pork chop (“I didn’t,” Mr. Sanders, who is also Jewish, assured him), listened to Mr. Sanders confide that “This celebrity stuff is strange,” and discussed “how far he’s come.” “His enthusiasm is growing” Mr. Sugarman said, because “people are responsive to what he is saying in a larger venue than has ever been the case before, and probably because they agree with him.”","year, time, like, new, think, way, come, long, change, want",us,politics
9049,Colorado Killer James Holmes’s Notes: Detailed Plans vs. ‘a Whole Lot of Crazy’ - The New York Times,"DENVER — The spiral notebook is a road map to murder, filled with plans, diagrams and to-do lists that James E. Holmes laid out in scrupulous detail before carrying out a shooting rampage in a Colorado movie theater. In his own handwriting, he plans a “mass murder spree” and considers theaters and times to attack for “maximum casualties.” He also plots his own psyche with pages of self-diagnosis of what he calls his “broken mind.” As his murder trial enters its second month, this notebook has become a Rorschach test of the thoughts of Mr. Holmes, the neuroscience graduate student who killed 12 people in one of the country’s worst mass shootings in recent years. Prosecutors say that he was sane and methodical, planning his actions with murderous intent. Defense lawyers, who have entered his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, say his writing brims with “a whole lot of crazy” — delusions about death, human worth and “negative infinity” that were the product of a profoundly diseased mind. The 12 jurors will be forced to examine the hazy border between mental illness and legal insanity. Key to the case is whether Mr. Holmes, despite his ravings and struggles with mental illness, was able to distinguish the difference between right and wrong, and was legally responsible for his actions, when he opened fire on a midnight movie screening in Aurora, Colo., in July 2012. On Thursday, a psychiatrist said Mr. Holmes, 27, was indeed able to know the difference and was legally sane. “Whatever he suffered from, it did not prevent him from forming the intent and knowing what he was doing and the consequences of what he was doing,” said Dr. William Reid, a psychiatrist who performed a court-ordered examination of Mr. Holmes. His testimony, the first from any of the mental health experts who have examined Mr. Holmes, provided crucial support for the prosecution. But it came in an unprompted opinion that drew an immediate objection from defense lawyers, who called for a mistrial, saying the jurors had heard testimony that muddied the legal standard for judging a person’s sanity. Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. refused their request. But the dispute reflected the tense and sensitive nature of the issues at the heart of this death penalty case. And the district attorney, George Brauchler, was forced to talk to Dr. Reid outside the jury’s presence to draw limits around what he could and could not say on the stand to avoid any other “missteps.” Dr. Reid spent about 22 hours interviewing Mr. Holmes, and jurors are expected to watch the entire video footage of his examination. Dr. Reid said he had spent about 300 hours preparing for the July 2014 interview. He read the notebook, watched footage of Mr. Holmes in jail and talked to mental health professionals who had spoken with him. Two years had passed since the shooting, and Mr. Holmes had been taking antipsychotic medication and antidepressants when the two men met. Jurors began watching the interview on Thursday afternoon. In it, Mr. Holmes wears a navy jail smock and has a beard. The conversation opens with chitchat about his treatment (“I’m in solitary”), his routine (“Exercise, reading, sleeping”) and his personality (“I’m kind of shy, I guess”), and edges toward his mental health history and the bloody minutes at the center of the case. Prosecutors have said that a second psychiatrist who examined Mr. Holmes for the court reached the same conclusion as Dr. Reid. Defense lawyers are expected to call their own experts, who will argue that Mr. Holmes was delusional and in a state of what they called “florid psychosis” the night of the shootings. The defense points to different pages of the notebook, ones bristling with nonsensical equations, ramblings about his “mind of madness” and pages covered with the word “Why?” Colorado is one of just 11 states where prosecutors have the burden of proof in insanity cases. Most states and the federal courts put that burden on defendants. Despite that hurdle for prosecutors, legal observers say Mr. Holmes’s lawyers are facing huge obstacles. For weeks, people who lost friends and loved ones, or who were scarred or paralyzed by Mr. Holmes’s bullets have taken the witness stand and recreated the bloody chaos inside Theater 9 that July 20. Their testimony has brought members of the gallery, and sometimes jurors, to tears. “The more horrendous the attack is, the more heinous the behavior, the less juries are willing to consider insanity,” said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego.  But as the case pivots to delve deeper into Mr. Holmes’s mind and his actions before and after the killing, experts say a growing collection of details suggests that he understood the gravity and wrongfulness of his plot. His notebook is filled with such deliberations. Should he attack an airport? No, he decides, too much security. On a sketch of the Century 16 theaters he would attack, he noted that a police station was just three minutes’ drive away. He wrote that he had a 99 percent chance of getting caught. Prosecutors say that as he assembled an arsenal of guns, ammunition and explosives, he used a credit card to which only he had access, different from the family account he used to pay his rent and buy food. On an AdultFriendFinder.com profile he completed days before the shooting, he wrote, “Will you visit me in prison?” After he was arrested just outside the theater, he asked two detectives at Aurora police headquarters, “There weren’t any children hurt, were there?” (There were, including 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was killed.) Dr. Steven Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist in Arizona who has been closely following the case, said he had no doubt that Mr. Holmes had a serious mental illness and had been “living his own internal nightmare for years.” But he said that the accumulating evidence suggested that Mr. Holmes “knew what he was doing, and what he was doing was wrong.”","people, day, gun, shooting, know, tell, man, police, come, kill",us,
1042,"Mueller Hopes Obstruction Inquiry Into Trump May Wrap Up by Sept. 1, Giuliani Says - The New York Times","WASHINGTON — The special counsel hopes to finish by Sept. 1 the investigation into whether President Trump obstructed the Russia inquiry, according to the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said on Sunday that waiting any longer would risk improperly influencing voters in November’s midterm elections. Mr. Giuliani said that the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, shared its timeline about two weeks ago amid negotiations over whether Mr. Trump will be questioned by investigators, adding that Mr. Mueller’s office said that the date was contingent on Mr. Trump’s sitting for an interview. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment. Wrapping up the obstruction case would not signal the end of Mr. Mueller’s work. That is one piece of his broader inquiry, a counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump associates coordinated with it. Counterintelligence investigations are used to gather information quietly about the activities of foreign powers and their agents — sometimes for years — and can result in criminal charges. Mr. Giuliani sought to frame the outcome of the obstruction investigation as pitting the credibility of one man against another: Mr. Trump vs. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, whom the president asked to end the investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The president’s request is one of the main episodes Mr. Mueller is examining to determine whether Mr. Trump had criminal intent to obstruct the Russia investigation. “We want the concentration of this to be on Comey versus the president’s credibility, and I think we win that and people get that,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he also hoped that the Justice Department would open a criminal investigation into Mr. Comey for perjury and his role in the disclosures to The New York Times last year about his encounters with the president that prompted Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Comey had damaged his credibility during his recent book tour and was an unreliable witness. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have long said that Mr. Comey’s accounts of their interactions, described in contemporaneous memos and congressional testimony, cannot be trusted. Mr. Comey declined to comment. A month after Mr. Giuliani was hired to represent the president, his legal strategy is coming into focus. By assailing Mr. Comey, he is targeting perhaps the main witness in the obstruction investigation, a tack that Mr. Trump’s lawyers also tried over the past year. They told both the special counsel and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, that Mr. Comey perjured himself and illegally leaked information, making the claims repeatedly in previously unreported letters described to The Times by several people who have seen them. And by putting an end date on the obstruction inquiry, he is apparently seeking to publicly pressure Mr. Mueller to stick to that timeline and trying to assuage the president by predicting the inquiry will end soon, a strategy that some of his other lawyers tried, with mixed results. The president, Mr. Giuliani said, wants any report summarizing the obstruction investigation to be made public. His comments about the timeline echoed tweets by Mr. Trump hours earlier, when he complained that a prolonged inquiry would hurt Republicans in the midterms, citing a Times report over the weekend that Mr. Mueller was investigating offers of help to the Trump campaign from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in an American election. “Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!” Mr. Giuliani said the article showed that Mr. Mueller had found no coordination with Russia by Mr. Trump’s advisers and had undertaken a desperate bid to uncover conspiracies with other governments. “It shows them at the end of the road — are we now going to check Africa and South America?” Mr. Giuliani said. He said that he and Mr. Mueller’s office were still hammering out the terms of an interview with the president. He portrayed his client as a willing interview subject, saying that in the president’s view, no evidence exists that his associates coordinated with Russia’s election interference. Mr. Giuliani said that an interview would be a distraction for the president and that the amount of preparation required meant that the president could not sit for questioning until after the scheduled summit meeting between Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on June 12 in Singapore. Based on that schedule, Mr. Giuliani said, the president could be questioned around Independence Day. The letters that Mr. Trump’s lawyers sent over the past year to Mr. Mueller and Mr. Rosenstein describe Mr. Comey as a witness lacking credibility and suggest that an obstruction case against the president had no basis. Two were written by Marc E. Kasowitz, Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer on the case at the time, within four days of each other in June 2017, and one on Jan. 29 by both John Dowd, who replaced Mr. Kasowitz and has since left the president’s legal team, and Jay Sekulow, who remains a part of it. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said the special counsel had no basis to build an obstruction case based on Mr. Comey’s firing because the president was free as the head of the executive branch to dismiss any subordinates. Mr. Comey, the lawyers said, was fired not to end the Russia investigation but because of how he handled the Clinton investigation. Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed with the president’s assessment, the lawyers said. Mr. Rosenstein, who is now overseeing Mr. Mueller’s investigation because Mr. Sessions recused himself, “actually helped to edit Mr. Comey’s termination letter and actively advised the president accordingly,” one letter said. The lawyers did not say whether Mr. Trump had asked for an end to the Flynn investigation. But their letters cited statements by the White House that denied Mr. Comey’s account. The lawyers also argued that Mr. Trump could not have impeded the investigation because there was no inquiry to obstruct. The letter said that the F.B.I. had concluded that Mr. Flynn had not committed a crime when he told agents in January 2017 that he did not discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition, an assertion later found to be false. The lawyers said that law enforcement officials had told the White House that the bureau did not believe Mr. Flynn had lied. “For all intents, purposes and appearances, the F.B.I. had accepted Flynn’s account; concluded that he was confused but truthful; decided not to investigate him further; and let him retain his clearance,” the letters said. It is not clear what basis his lawyers have for those assertions. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to investigators and is cooperating with the special counsel inquiry. The letters also said that Mr. Comey had told Congress in a closed-door briefing in March 2017 that Mr. Flynn had not lied to the F.B.I. in the interview and was merely confused. Mr. Comey said last month on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that that assertion was not accurate. The lawyers took issue with how Mr. Comey had described his interactions with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. They noted that in congressional testimony after he was fired, Mr. Comey said that he did not push back on the president’s request, and they labeled his memos “self-serving notes.” “The president had every right to express his view of the case,” the lawyers said, adding that “a president can also order the termination of an investigation by the Justice Department or F.B.I. at any time and for any reason.” By firing Mr. Flynn, the lawyers said, Mr. Trump “actually facilitated the pursuit of justice.” The lawyers also addressed another issue that has emerged about Mr. Trump’s behavior in office: his repeated criticisms — often on Twitter — of the F.B.I. and Justice Department. The lawyers said that Mr. Trump’s statements were simply him doing his job. “It is also worth responding to the popular suggestion that the president’s public criticisms of the F.B.I. either constitutes obstruction or serves as evidence of obstruction,” the letter said. “Such criticism ignores the sacred responsibility of the president to hold his subordinates accountable — a function not unlike public congressional oversight hearings. After all, the F.B.I. is not above the law and we are now learning of the disappointing results of a lack of accountability in both the D.O.J. and F.B.I.” Their arguments had limited success. The Justice Department officials responded by asking its inspector general to examine how the contents of Mr. Comey’s memos were disclosed.","Clinton, Department, email, F.B.I., State, investigation, private, Comey, official, information",us,politics
6603,"For Palestinians, Raising Arabian Horses Is ‘the Hobby of the Poor’ - The New York Times","JERUSALEM — In the violent East Jerusalem slum of Issawiya, trash burned next to an open bin, filling the air with an acrid stench. Arabic graffiti covered a stone wall on one side of a steep lane scattered with stones left from clashes between Palestinian residents and Israeli soldiers. A knot of children stopped and eyed two strangers with suspicion. Then a gray metal gate rumbled open near the top of the street. A pair of exquisitely groomed Arabian horses emerged, their hooves clacking on the dusty pavement. The horses pranced toward the center of town with their riders, Alaa Mustafa, 24, and his cousin Oday Muheisan, 19. Behind them, the open gate revealed a tiny, five-sided lot for exercising horses and a stable with a dozen stalls amid a jumble of apartment buildings. The two gleaming black horses, certified purebreds named Rawnaq and Furys, provided a glimpse of a Palestinian passion — some call it an obsession — for raising show horses, racehorses and more modest steeds in what might seem like impossible conditions. The horses are bred and to some extent trained in gritty East Jerusalem neighborhoods like Issawiya, Tur and Jabal al-Mukaber, often by families who struggle to share tiny, cramped homes. “In America, they call raising horses the hobby of the rich,” said Muhamed Hamdan, 25, a Palestinian trainer who studied in the United States. “Here, it’s the hobby of the poor.” Although the stables are usually tight and dingy, their surroundings can be breathtaking. One recent evening, darkness fell on a tumbledown stable hidden among olive trees on a hill above the Garden of Gethsemane. Fares Salim, 22, led a white mare out of her stall and held the bridle high. Behind them were the minarets and steeples of Jerusalem’s Old City and the golden Dome of the Rock. Larger stables dot villages and towns of every size in the occupied West Bank, and many families raise their own horses. Trainers like Mr. Hamdan, who runs a stable with two dozen horses in Turmusaya, about a 90-minute drive north of Jerusalem, also are paid to get the horses ready to compete in shows and races — or simply look good as they canter through the area’s streets, valleys, olive groves and stony hills. Some wealthy Palestinians share the same passion, operating ranches surrounded by little more than Bedouin shanty towns and scrubland reminiscent of the American West, and trainers race through the landscape with the abandon of extras in a cowboy movie. “If you don’t love horses, you’re not living,” said Shadi Abu Obeid, a businessman who owns a ranch with 28 horses. Many Palestinians say that affection helps them endure life under Israeli occupation. Palestinians and Israelis in the business, as well as foreign trainers and judges who know the region, say that Arabian horses have another effect that is almost magical: They coax Israelis and Palestinians into the same arenas, where the conflict briefly melts away and everyone admires the horses as they strut, dance, gallop and compete for trophies. “The Arabian horse makes the world so small and puts people together,” said Renata Schibler, a Swiss official with the European Conference of Arab Horse Organizations, who volunteers as a judge in horse shows — essentially, beauty contests — in Israel, where both Israeli and Palestinian horses compete. “The Israelis, Palestinians, sitting together, enjoying the horses. It’s difficult to describe.” Tareq al-Sheikh, the general manager of a youth sports club in Jericho that has a full-size racetrack, training fields and stalls for 97 horses, said that enthusiasm has soared in the past 10 to 15 years. He estimated that nearly 1,000 families now keep horses in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Other enthusiasts and trainers put the number in the tens of thousands, but no one seems to have an official count. That day in Issawiya, Ali Attiyah, 13, stood with a group of friends watching as the cousins wound through the neighborhood’s crowded main market on their mounts. “We know these guys — they’re from the Mustafa family,” Mr. Attiyah said. “They have the best horses!” Riding sparks the same dreams as sports in any city. On another day, Rasha Abdeen explained why she brought her son, Zain, 10, for lessons at a training area with wooden barriers and brightly painted tires in Tur. “First of all, my son loves animals,” she said. “The second reason is, one day I anticipate my son will be a professional horseman.” The Palestinian brand of horse expert is short on pastoral niceties and long on urban brashness. “When you bring a kid from a refugee camp, he’s street-smart, savvy,” said Nadar al-Demary, a trainer from Jabal al-Mukaber who works and teaches at the stable and riding school in Tur, with a view all the way to the Dead Sea. An echo of American urban culture is hard to miss. Amir Kartom, 38, who was born and raised in Chicago but recently moved to the West Bank to join family, said he was stabling his first horse with Mr. Hamdan, in Turmusaya. “I love horses, man, since the day I was born,” Mr. Kartom said in English. As a boy, Mr. Hamdan studied with Michael Byatt, a well-known trainer and breeder based in Houston. Reached by telephone, Mr. Byatt called Mr. Hamdan “a brilliant little kid,” recalling that he had corralled a runaway horse at a show in Kentucky before Mr. Byatt’s staff could react. Palestinian horses have begun turning heads at shows in Israel, said Eli Kahaloon, who with his wife, Chen Kedar, owns a well-known Israeli stable called Ariela Arabians. Mr. Kahaloon estimated that of the 165 or so horses at a show he attended in northern Israel in May, 60 percent to 70 percent were owned by Palestinian citizens of Israel. He said that 10 to 20 horses had arrived from the West Bank, despite the complexity of obtaining permits and bringing them through military checkpoints. Mr. Kahaloon said that in the past decade or more, Palestinians had greatly improved the quality of their stock by purchasing better horses for breeding. In the V.I.P. section of the stands at the show, groups of Israeli and Palestinian breeders amiably mingled and cheered for their respective horses. The contest had “nothing to do with politics,” said Mohammad Al-Mahdi, a breeder from Jenin, on the northern West Bank. “Anyone who comes to shows like this loves the horses.”","people, day, gun, shooting, know, tell, man, police, come, kill",world,middleeast
8936,Illinois Supreme Court Rejects Lawmakers’ Pension Overhaul - The New York Times,"CHICAGO — The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday rejected changes that legislators made to fix a deeply troubled public pension system, leaving the state where it had started — with a significant budget crisis, a vastly underfunded pension program and no plan in sight. All seven members of the state’s highest court found that a pension overhaul lawmakers had agreed to almost a year and a half ago violated the Illinois Constitution. The changes would have curtailed future cost-of-living adjustments for workers, raised the age of retirement for some and put a cap on pensions for those with the highest salaries. But under the state Constitution, benefits promised as part of a pension system for public workers “shall not be diminished or impaired.”  “Crisis is not an excuse to abandon the rule of law,” Justice Lloyd A. Karmeier wrote in an opinion. “It is a summons to defend it.” In recent years, plenty of states and cities have wrestled with paying their pension obligations, but Illinois’s problems have been among the worst, leaving public sector workers uncertain about their retirements, the state’s budget strained and the state’s credit ratings sinking. Around the nation, political leaders have sought to solve the shortfalls, in part, by cutting pension benefits, and state constitutional provisions have emerged as one way to try to block such changes.  Here, the court’s finding on Friday was viewed as a victory for unions and state workers, but also a significant escalation of the state’s financial challenges, even as Illinois’s political landscape has grown more complex. “Our path forward from here is now much more difficult, and every direction will be more painful than the balance we struck in Senate Bill 1,” said State Representative Elaine Nekritz, a Democrat, referring to the package of pension changes lawmakers passed at the end of 2013. By then, Democrats who at the time controlled the state legislature and the governor’s office had been debating for several years how to solve the mounting pension crisis in a state where unions have long supported Democrats. Unions vehemently opposed the proposals, which they said undid promised pension benefits.  In the end, state officials argued, in essence, that the economic circumstances required extreme measures. By some estimates, the state’s pensions had been underfinanced by more than $100 billion — among the worst holes for public pension systems around the nation. So lawmakers agreed to a package that included the benefit changes over objections from workers and that, in exchange, was to lower workers’ pension contributions and require an increase in state payments into the system. The deal, signed into law by Pat Quinn, the Democrat who was governor then, was expected to save $160 billion over 30 years.  The court’s decision on Friday had long been predicted by legal experts here. In a 38-page written opinion, the justices sounded an unsympathetic note to suggestions that the state was forced to take drastic action when faced with what amounted to a financial emergency. The court noted that state lawmakers had, over decades, delayed or shorted what they should have contributed into the system, which covers state workers, teachers outside Chicago and others. “The General Assembly may find itself in crisis, but it is a crisis which other public pension systems managed to avoid,” Justice Karmeier wrote. He added later, “It is a crisis for which the General Assembly itself is largely responsible.” Labor officials lauded the decision. “We are thankful that the Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the will of the people, overturned this unfair and unconstitutional law, and protected the hard-earned life savings of teachers, police, firefighters, nurses, caregivers and other public service workers and retirees,” Michael T. Carrigan, the president of the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O., said.  Yet the ruling left the state’s fiscal future in doubt, and lawmakers themselves expressed uncertainty about the challenge ahead: how to solve a gaping pension deficit without taking away any benefits. The political environment, too, has grown more complex since Mr. Quinn was replaced this year by Bruce Rauner, the state’s first Republican governor in more than a decade. After speaking to businesspeople here on Friday, Mr. Rauner said he had expected the pension changes to be overturned and had disagreed with how they changed retirees’ benefits. He said he believed that voters should consider a constitutional amendment that would mark a distinction between guarantees of benefits already earned and changes to future benefits. As it is, under the state’s Constitution, officials may assign new benefits to future workers, but cannot diminish benefits already promised. “Rather than spend years in court, we’d rather do a constitutional referendum and try to clarify that benefits earned should be protected, but the future is unknown and it can be higher or lower,” Mr. Rauner said.  During his speech, Mr. Rauner issued a grave assessment of the state’s fiscal health, as he has in appearances around the state in recent weeks. “If Illinois was a corporation, it would probably need to file for bankruptcy,” he said. Still, Mr. Rauner said he has been in talks with legislative leaders and hoped to have a budget deal and a new pension solution in place by the end of the month. Lawmakers sounded far less certain. A spokesman for Michael J. Madigan, the speaker of the State House, said he was reviewing the decision. John J. Cullerton, the Senate president, said he had long been concerned about the constitutionality of what lawmakers passed in 2013 and that he viewed the ruling as a victory for retirees, public workers and “everyone who respects the plain language” of the state Constitution. “That victory, however, should be balanced against the grave financial realities we will continue to face without true reforms,” Mr. Cullerton said, adding that he was prepared to “work with all parties to advance a real solution that adheres to the Illinois Constitution.” The decision could also have ramifications in Chicago, which is dealing with underfunded pension systems and a similar question: If pension benefits cannot be changed, how can the system be spared? In 2014, Mayor Rahm Emanuel pushed Illinois lawmakers to approve a plan that would start to ease some of his city’s crippling pension problems by requiring some municipal workers to pay more for their retirement benefits and by granting smaller than expected increases in those benefits. The Chicago plan — which would affect two of the city’s pension funds and grew out of talks with some of the unions — appeared to face legal questions similar to those involving the state’s overhaul.  In a statement on Friday, Mr. Emanuel said the city’s approach would not be affected by the court’s decision in the state case “as we believe our plan fully complies with the state Constitution because it fundamentally preserves and protects worker pensions rather than diminishing or impairing them.” In the State Supreme Court opinion, the justices took note of Illinois’s financial circumstances, but suggested that those were not enough to overlook the Constitution. “The financial challenges facing state and local governments in Illinois are well known and significant,” the opinion read. “In ruling as we have today, we do not mean to minimize the gravity of the state’s problems or the magnitude of the difficulty facing our elected representatives. It is our obligation, however, just as it is theirs, to ensure that the law is followed.”","year, time, like, new, think, way, come, long, change, want",us,
